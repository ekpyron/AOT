# Embedding of Abstract Object Theory in Isabelle/HOL

This repository contains an embedding of [_Abstract Object Theory_](http://mally.stanford.edu/theory.html)
in [Isabelle/HOL](https://isabelle.in.tum.de).

It implements major parts of the most recent presentation of object theory given in [Edward Zalta](https://mally.stanford.edu/zalta.html)'s
[Principia Logico-Metaphysica](https://mally.stanford.edu/principia.pdf) in context of the
[Computational Metaphysics project](https://mally.stanford.edu/cm/) of the
[Metaphysics Research Lab](https://mally.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University.

A [more readable HTML presentation of the theory files](https://aot.ekpyron.org/) is
automatically generated form this repository.

An [older and now outdated version of the embedding](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/PLM.html)
was published in the [Archive of Formal Proofs](https://www.isa-afp.org/).
