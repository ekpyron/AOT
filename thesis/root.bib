abstract="Partizan Games (PGs) were invented by John H. Conway and are described in his book On Numbers and Games. We formalize PGs in Higher Order Logic extended with ZF axioms (HOLZF) using Isabelle, a mechanical proof assistant. We show that PGs can be defined as the unique fixpoint of a function that arises naturally from Conway's original definition. While the construction of PGs in HOLZF relies heavily on the ZF axioms, operations on PGs are defined on a game type that hides its set theoretic origins. A polymorphic type of sets that are not bigger than ZF sets facilitates this. We formalize the induction principle that Conway uses throughout his proofs about games, and prove its correctness. For these purposes we examine how the notions of well-foundedness in HOL and ZF are related in HOLZF. Finally, games (modulo equality) are added to Isabelle's numeric types by showing that they are an instance of the axiomatic type class of partially ordered abelian groups.",

This convention is known to cause considerable trouble in cases of substitution. In the present paper a different notational system is developed, where occurrences of variables are indicated by integers giving the “distance” to the binding λ instead of a name attached to that λ. The system is claimed to be efficient for automatic formula manipulation as well as for metalingual discussion. As an example the most essential part of a proof of the Church-Rosser theorem is presented in this namefree calculus.}

volume={48},
number={2},
pages={305-405},
abstract={This article introduces, studies, and applies a new system of logic which is called `HYPE'. In HYPE, formulas are evaluated at states that may exhibit truth value gaps (partiality) and truth value gluts (overdeterminedness). Simple and natural semantic rules for negation and the conditional operator are formulated based on an incompatibility relation and a partial fusion operation on states. The semantics is worked out in formal and philosophical detail, and a sound and complete axiomatization is provided both for the propositional and the predicate logic of the system. The propositional logic of HYPE is shown to contain first-degree entailment, to have the Finite Model Property, to be decidable, to have the Disjunction Property, and to extend intuitionistic propositional logic conservatively when intuitionistic negation is defined appropriately by HYPE's logical connectives. Furthermore, HYPE's first-order logic is a conservative extension of intuitionistic logic with the Constant Domain Axiom, when intuitionistic negation is again defined appropriately. The system allows for simple model constructions and intuitive Euler-Venn-like diagrams, and its logical structure matches structures well-known from ordinary mathematics, such as from optimization theory, combinatorics, and graph theory. HYPE may also be used as a general logical framework in which different systems of logic can be studied, compared, and combined. In particular, HYPE is found to relate in interesting ways to classical logic and various systems of relevance and paraconsistent logic, many-valued logic, and truthmaker semantics. On the philosophical side, if used as a logic for theories of type-free truth, HYPE is shown to address semantic paradoxes such as the Liar Paradox by extending non-classical fixed-point interpretations of truth by a conditional as well-behaved as that of intuitionistic logic. Finally, HYPE may be used as a background system for modal operators that create hyperintensional contexts, though the details of this application need to be left to follow-up work.},

This chapter discusses the semantic ideas underlying modern modal logic, and in particular, Kripke semantics—or relational semantics. It introduces the basic model theoretic constructions, explores links between modal logic and classical logic, both on models and on frames, and examines the extent to which the key semantic ideas transfer to richer modal logics and languages while maintaining a relatively low computational complexity. The basic modal languages and the graphs over which they are interpreted are discussed. The chapter also introduces the notion of bisimulation, based on which, modal logic as a fragment of first-order logic is characterized. The computability and computational complexity of modal logic is examined. The level of frames and the link between modal and classical logic are explored. Three alternatives to relational semantics––namely, algebraic semantics, neighborhood semantics, and topological semantics are also discussed.}

Thanks to its adherence to the so-called `LCF approach', the system can be extended with new inference rules without compromising soundness. While retaining this reliability and programmability from earlier HOL systems, HOL Light is distinguished by its clean and simple design and extremely small logical kernel.

abstract = {The LogiKEy workbench and dataset for ethical and legal reasoning is presented. This workbench simultaneously supports development, experimentation, assessment and deployment of formal logics and ethical and legal theories at different conceptual layers. More concretely, it comprises, in form of a dataset (Isabelle/HOL theory files), formal encodings of multiple deontic logics, logic combinations, deontic paradoxes and normative theories in the higher-order proof assistant system Isabelle/HOL. The data were acquired through application of the LogiKEy methodology, which supports experimentation with different normative theories, in different application scenarios, and which is not tied to specific logics or logic combinations. Our workbench consolidates related research contributions of the authors and it may serve as a starting point for further studies and experiments in flexible and expressive ethical and legal reasoning. It may also support hands-on teaching of non-trivial logic formalisms in lecture courses and tutorials. The LogiKEy methodology and framework is discussed in more detail in the companion research article titled “Designing Normative Theories for Ethical and Legal Reasoning: LogiKEy Framework, Methodology, and Tool Support” [5].}

abstract = {A framework and methodology—termed LogiKEy—for the design and engineering of ethical reasoners, normative theories and deontic logics is presented. The overall motivation is the development of suitable means for the control and governance of intelligent autonomous systems. LogiKEy's unifying formal framework is based on semantical embeddings of deontic logics, logic combinations and ethico-legal domain theories in expressive classic higher-order logic (HOL). This meta-logical approach enables the provision of powerful tool support in LogiKEy: off-the-shelf theorem provers and model finders for HOL are assisting the LogiKEy designer of ethical intelligent agents to flexibly experiment with underlying logics and their combinations, with ethico-legal domain theories, and with concrete examples—all at the same time. Continuous improvements of these off-the-shelf provers, without further ado, leverage the reasoning performance in LogiKEy. Case studies, in which the LogiKEy framework and methodology has been applied and tested, give evidence that HOL's undecidability often does not hinder efficient experimentation.}
