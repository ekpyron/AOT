abstract = {In ordinary lambda calculus the occurrences of a bound variable are made recognizable by the use of one and the same (otherwise irrelevant) name at all occurrences. This convention is known to cause considerable trouble in cases of substitution. In the present paper a different notational system is developed, where occurrences of variables are indicated by integers giving the “distance” to the binding λ instead of a name attached to that λ. The system is claimed to be efficient for automatic formula manipulation as well as for metalingual discussion. As an example the most essential part of a proof of the Church-Rosser theorem is presented in this namefree calculus.}

volume={48},
number={2},
pages={305-405},
abstract={This article introduces, studies, and applies a new system of logic which is called `HYPE'. In HYPE, formulas are evaluated at states that may exhibit truth value gaps (partiality) and truth value gluts (overdeterminedness). Simple and natural semantic rules for negation and the conditional operator are formulated based on an incompatibility relation and a partial fusion operation on states. The semantics is worked out in formal and philosophical detail, and a sound and complete axiomatization is provided both for the propositional and the predicate logic of the system. The propositional logic of HYPE is shown to contain first-degree entailment, to have the Finite Model Property, to be decidable, to have the Disjunction Property, and to extend intuitionistic propositional logic conservatively when intuitionistic negation is defined appropriately by HYPE's logical connectives. Furthermore, HYPE's first-order logic is a conservative extension of intuitionistic logic with the Constant Domain Axiom, when intuitionistic negation is again defined appropriately. The system allows for simple model constructions and intuitive Euler-Venn-like diagrams, and its logical structure matches structures well-known from ordinary mathematics, such as from optimization theory, combinatorics, and graph theory. HYPE may also be used as a general logical framework in which different systems of logic can be studied, compared, and combined. In particular, HYPE is found to relate in interesting ways to classical logic and various systems of relevance and paraconsistent logic, many-valued logic, and truthmaker semantics. On the philosophical side, if used as a logic for theories of type-free truth, HYPE is shown to address semantic paradoxes such as the Liar Paradox by extending non-classical fixed-point interpretations of truth by a conditional as well-behaved as that of intuitionistic logic. Finally, HYPE may be used as a background system for modal operators that create hyperintensional contexts, though the details of this application need to be left to follow-up work.},

This chapter discusses the semantic ideas underlying modern modal logic, and in particular, Kripke semantics—or relational semantics. It introduces the basic model theoretic constructions, explores links between modal logic and classical logic, both on models and on frames, and examines the extent to which the key semantic ideas transfer to richer modal logics and languages while maintaining a relatively low computational complexity. The basic modal languages and the graphs over which they are interpreted are discussed. The chapter also introduces the notion of bisimulation, based on which, modal logic as a fragment of first-order logic is characterized. The computability and computational complexity of modal logic is examined. The level of frames and the link between modal and classical logic are explored. Three alternatives to relational semantics––namely, algebraic semantics, neighborhood semantics, and topological semantics are also discussed.}

Thanks to its adherence to the so-called `LCF approach', the system can be extended with new inference rules without compromising soundness. While retaining this reliability and programmability from earlier HOL systems, HOL Light is distinguished by its clean and simple design and extremely small logical kernel. Despite this, it provides powerful proof tools and has been applied to some non-trivial tasks in the formalization of mathematics and industrial formal verification.",

The overall motivation is the development of suitable means for the control and governance of intelligent autonomous systems. LogiKEy's unifying formal framework is based on semantical embeddings of deontic logics, logic combinations and ethico-legal domain theories in expressive classic higher-order logic (HOL). This meta-logical approach enables the provision of powerful tool support in LogiKEy: off-the-shelf theorem provers and model finders for HOL are assisting the LogiKEy designer of ethical intelligent agents to flexibly experiment with underlying logics and their combinations, with ethico-legal domain theories, and with concrete examples—all at the same time. Continuous improvements of these off-the-shelf provers, without further ado, leverage the reasoning performance in LogiKEy. Case studies, in which the LogiKEy framework and methodology has been applied and tested, give evidence that HOL's undecidability often does not hinder efficient experimentation.}

Contra Quine, this does not disqualify second-order logic from its role in foundational studies. To wax Quinean, why should there be a sharp border separating mathematics from logic, especially the logic of mathematics?}",

abstract="We have applied the automatic theorem-prover Prover9 to prove first eleven theorems of Part 1 of Benedict de Spinoza's Ethics. We have used a previous formalization of that segment developed by Blum and Malinovich. We have found Prover9 to be very efficient, providing proofs in tens of miliseconds. It appears that the only, but fundamental, limitation for testing philosophical reasoning is related to the difficulty of unique formalization.",
