abstract = {A domain-specific language can be implemented by embedding within a general-purpose host language. This embedding may be deep or shallow, depending on whether terms in the language construct syntactic or semantic representations. The deep and shallow styles are closely related, and intimately connected to folds; in this paper, we explore that connection.},

Contra Quine, this does not disqualify second-order logic from its role in foundational studies. To wax Quinean, why should there be a sharp border separating mathematics from logic, especially the logic of mathematics?}",

abstract="We have applied the automatic theorem-prover Prover9 to prove first eleven theorems of Part 1 of Benedict de Spinoza's Ethics. We have used a previous formalization of that segment developed by Blum and Malinovich. We have found Prover9 to be very efficient, providing proofs in tens of miliseconds. It appears that the only, but fundamental, limitation for testing philosophical reasoning is related to the difficulty of unique formalization.",
