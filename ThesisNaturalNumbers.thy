chapter\<open>Natural Numbers in AOT\<close>text\<open>\label{NaturalNumbers}\<close>

text\<open>
While AOT can represent mathematical theories (including their deductive systems) themselves
as @{emph \<open>abstract objects\<close>}, as mentioned in section (TODO: adjust ref; likely~\ref{ImplicationsForPhilosophyOfMathematics}), it distinguishes this analysis of
@{emph \<open>Theoretical Mathematics\<close>} from the notion of @{emph \<open>Natural Mathematics\<close>}. @{emph \<open>Natural\<close>}
Mathematics consists of ordinary, pretheoretic claims about mathematical objects (TODO: cite PLM (303))
and arises directly as abstraction of the exemplification patterns on the ordinary objects rather
than being based on the axioms of some mathematical theory.

Following this idea, the claim of PLM's Chapter 14 (TODO: cite) is that natural numbers and Peano
Arithmetic can be naturally defined within object theory and the laws they abide by up to and including
Second-Order Peano Arithmetic can be derived without having to appeal to any intrinsically mathematical
axioms or notions.

We have reproduced parts of this construction in our implementation@{footnote \<open>At the
time of writing the implementation encompasses the construction of natural numbers including
mathematical induction. We expect a full derivation of Second-Order Peano Arithmetic in the
foreseeable future.\<close>} and arrived at the following results:
  \<^item> The construction of natural numbers is sound and mathematical induction is consistently derivable.
  \<^item> We could model the additional axioms required in the construction in our framework.
  \<^item> We could generalize one of the aforementioned axioms, strengthening the theoretical basis and
    justification of the construction.
  \<^item> We could suggest several amendments to the construction and discover and fix several
    minor errors and inconsistencies in the presentation.

In particular, we can derive the Dedekind-Peano Postulates about Natural Numbers: (TODO: improve formulations and cite)
    \<^enum> Zero is a Natural Number.
    \<^enum> No Natural Number has Zero as its Successor.
    \<^enum> If a Natural Number @{text k} succeeds the numbers @{text n} and @{text m}, then @{text \<open>n = m\<close>}.
    \<^enum> Every Natural Number has a Successor.
    \<^enum> Mathematical Induction:
      If
          \<^item> Zero exemplifies a property @{text F} and
          \<^item> for any number @{text n}, it follows from the fact that @{text n} exemplifies @{text F} that
            the successor of @{text n} exemplifies @{text F},
      then @{text F} is exemplified by all natural numbers.
\<close>
text\<open>
Interestingly, the paradox discovered in~\cite{MScThesis} and the resulting evolution of AOT have
had repercussions on the details of the construction. We will describe this interaction in more
detail in the following sections, while reproducing the construction Nodelman and Zalta present in PLM chapter~14.
TODO: Maybe point out some examples like the elimination of the
Rigidity axioms, which were required for constructing modally rigid numbers, based on the extension
of relation comprehension and "Kirchner's Theorem". Also make sure this point sufficiently comes across
in the next sections.

TODO: remark about forgoing details about logical significance of terms throughout the following chapter,
while PLM and the implementation make them explicit. Also think about how best to cite the implementation
throughout the text.
\<close>

section\<open>General Idea of the Construction\<close>

text\<open>
The strategy for constructing natural numbers in AOT follows the idea of Frege's Theorem. (TODO: cite.)
Frege showed that the Peano axioms can be derived from @{emph \<open>Hume's Principle\<close>} using Second-Order
Logic. Hume's Principle states that the number of @{term F}s is equal to the number of @{term G}s if and
only if @{term F} and @{term G} are @{emph \<open>equinumerous\<close>}. Two relations are @{emph \<open>equinumerous\<close>},
if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between them or, in other words, if and only if
there is a bijection between the objects exemplifying @{term F} and @{term G}. (TODO: add some citations).

Frege himself derived Hume's Principle from @{emph \<open>Basic Law V\<close>}, which together with second-order
logic leads to Russel's Paradox. However, deriving Peano arithmetic @{emph \<open>from\<close>} Hume's Principle
itself does not require @{emph \<open>Basic Law V\<close>}. In Chapter 14 PLM, Nodelman and Zalta propose a
definition of @{emph \<open>equinumerosity\<close>} and @{emph \<open>the number of @{term F}s\<close>} in object theory
and derive Hume's Principle. Based on that Natural Numbers and Peano Arithmetic become consistently
derivable as expected.
\<close>

section\<open>Equinumerosity of Relations\<close>

text\<open>On the basis of traditional mathematical training based on set theory and functional logic,
the seemingly most natural conception of @{emph \<open>equinumerosity\<close>} is based on the notion of a
bijection. Two properties are equinumerous, respectively they count the same number of objects,
if and only if there is a bijection between the sets of objects they exemplify.

However, this conception of equinumerosity relies on objects of theoretical mathematics
and their axiomatization (sets, functions, bijections). While object theory can in fact define
those notions as well, it takes relations to be the more primitive, fundamental concept and thereby
prefers a definition in terms of relations alone.

The concept of there being a bijection between the sets of objects two properties exemplify can 
equivalently be captured by the notion of there being a @{emph \<open>one-to-one correspondence\<close>} between
the properties.
\<close>

subsection\<open>One-to-One Correspondences\<close>

text\<open>
A @{emph \<open>one-to-one correspondence\<close>} between the properties @{term F} and @{term G} is a relation
@{term R}, s.t. (1) for every object @{term x} that exemplifies @{term F}, there is a unique object
@{term y} exemplifying @{term G}, s.t. @{term x} bears @{term R} to @{term y} and conversely (2) for
every object @{term y} that exemplifies @{term G}, there is a unique object @{term x} exemplifying
@{term F}, s.t. @{term x} bears @{term R} to @{term y}. Formally (see~\nameref{AOT:1-1-cor}):@{footnote \<open>Note that similar to
the previous sections we are again directly quoting theorems verified in the Isabelle theory.
Also note that, for simplicity, we state an equivalence in place of the corresponding @{emph \<open>definition by equivalence\<close>},
which would require additional conjuncts  in the definiens, that asserting that the free terms denote.
This is discussed in more detail in (TODO: cite).\<close>}

@{lemma[display] \<open>print_as_theorem \<guillemotleft>R |: F \<^sub>1\<^sub>-\<^sub>1\<longleftrightarrow> G \<equiv> \<forall>x ([F]x \<rightarrow> \<exists>!y ([G]y & [R]xy)) & \<forall>y ([G]y \<rightarrow> \<exists>!x ([F]x & [R]xy))\<guillemotright>\<close> by (auto dest: "&E" "1-1-cor"[THEN "\<equiv>\<^sub>d\<^sub>fE"] intro!: print_as_theoremI "\<equiv>I" "\<rightarrow>I" "&I" "cqt:2[const_var]"[axiom_inst] "1-1-cor"[THEN "\<equiv>\<^sub>d\<^sub>fI"])}

However, this unrestricted notion of one-to-one correspondence is not well suited for a definition
of equinumerosity that validates Hume's principle in AOT. The intuitive reason for this is that abstract
objects cannot be counted. In particular, recall that there are distinct, but
exemplification-indistinguishable abstract objects (TODO: make sure this is mentioned earlier; see~\nameref{AOT:aclassical2}):

@{thm[display] "aclassical2"[print_as_theorem]}

Based on this fact, we can prove that there is no one-to-one correspondence between @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>A!\<guillemotright>\<close>}
and itself:@{footnote \<open>We choose this opportunity to showcase that reasoning in object theory using
our embedding in Isabelle is intuitively understandable. TODO: maybe add "once more"\<close>}

text\<open>
So if @{emph \<open>equinumerosity\<close>} was contingent on the existence of a full one-to-one correspondence,
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>A!\<guillemotright>\<close>} would not be equinumerous to itself and consequently equinumerosity
would not be an equivalence relation. However, Frege's Theorem does rely on equinumerosity being
an equivalence relation. (TODO: work out this requirement later on) Fortunately, there is a natural solution to this issue, namely restricting
the analysis to the domain of @{emph \<open>ordinary objects\<close>}.
\<close>

subsection\<open>One-to-One Correspondences on the Ordinary Objects\<close>

text\<open>
As mentioned in the introduction of this chapter, natural mathematics arises from abstracting
patterns of @{emph \<open>ordinary\<close>} objects. And ordinary objects are what can naturally be counted.
Hence Nodelman and Zalta introduce the notion of one-to-one correspondences @{emph \<open>among the ordinary
objects\<close>}. To that end, they introduce the restricted variables @{term u}, @{term v}, @{term r}, @{term s}
that range over only the ordinary objects.@{footnote \<open>Recall the discussion about reproducing
restricted variables in the embedding in: TODO.\<close>} Using these restricted variables, a one-to-one
correspondence among the ordinary objects can be defined in the same way as a full one-to-one
correspondence (see~\nameref{AOT:equi:2}):

\begin{quote}
@{lemma[display] \<open>print_as_theorem \<guillemotleft>R |: F \<^sub>1\<^sub>-\<^sub>1\<longleftrightarrow>\<^sub>E G \<equiv> \<forall>u ([F]u \<rightarrow> \<exists>!v ([G]v & [R]uv)) & \<forall>v ([G]v \<rightarrow> \<exists>!u ([F]u & [R]uv))\<guillemotright>\<close> by (auto dest: "&E" "equi:2"[THEN "\<equiv>\<^sub>d\<^sub>fE"] intro!: print_as_theoremI "\<equiv>I" "\<rightarrow>I" "&I" "cqt:2[const_var]"[axiom_inst] "equi:2"[THEN "\<equiv>\<^sub>d\<^sub>fI"])}
\end{quote}
\<close>

subsection\<open>Definition of Equinumerosity\<close>text\<open>\label{DefinitionOfEquinumerosity}\<close>

text\<open>
Based on one-to-one correspondences on the ordinary objects, equinumerosity on the ordinary objects
can be defined as suggested above: two relations are equinumerous@{text \<open>\<^sub>E\<close>}, if and only if there is a one-to-one
correspondence on the ordinary objects between them (see~\nameref{AOT:equi:3}):@{footnote \<open>In the following sections we will drop the explicit mention
of the restriction to the ordinary objects and simply talk about @{emph \<open>equinumerosity\<close>} and being @{emph \<open>equinumerous\<close>}
instead of @{emph \<open>equinumerosity on the ordinary objects\<close>} and @{emph \<open>equinumerous@{text \<open>\<^sub>E\<close>}\<close>}.\<close>}

\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] "equi:3"[of F G]}
\end{quote}

Equinumerosity on the ordinary objects is indeed an equivalence relation (see~\nameref{AOT:eq-part:1}):

\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] "eq-part:1"[of _ F, print_as_theorem] "eq-part:2"[of _ F G, print_as_theorem] "eq-part:3"[of _ F G H, print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}

Reflexivity can be shown by using the identity on the ordinary objects @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>(=\<^sub>E)\<guillemotright>\<close>} as witness for
the existence of a one-to-one-correspondence@{text \<open>\<^sub>E\<close>} between any relation and itself. Note that this
is only possible, since, in contrast to general identity, identity on the ordinary objects is a relation.

Symmetry is a simple consequence of the symmetry of the definition of one-to-one correspondences.

Transitivitity requires a slightly more verbose proof (see: TODO: cite), that hinges on the fact that
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<lambda>xy O!x & O!y & \<exists>v ([G]v & [R\<^sub>1]xv & [R\<^sub>2]vy)]\<guillemotright>\<close>} can be chosen as a witness for the existence
of a one-to-one-correspondence@{text \<open>\<^sub>E\<close>} between @{term F} and @{term H}, if @{term R\<^sub>1} is a one-to-one-correspondence@{text \<open>\<^sub>E\<close>}
between @{term F} and @{term G} and @{term R\<^sub>2} is a one-to-one-correspondence@{text \<open>\<^sub>E\<close>} between @{term G} and @{term H}.
\<close>

subsection\<open>Properties of Equinumerosity\<close>

text\<open>
Nodelmann and Zalta continue to derive a variety of properties of equinumerosity that are helpful
for the remainder of the construction. While a full account of the progression of theorems can be
found in PLM (TODO: cite), respectively in our implementation in (TODO: cite), the following is a
noteworthy selection of these auxiliary theorems:

Properties that are unexemplified on the ordinary objects are equinumerous (any relation may serve
as one-to-one-correspondence@{text \<open>\<^sub>E\<close>} between them; see~\nameref{AOT:empty-approx:1}):
\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] "empty-approx:1"[of _ F H, print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}

A property @{term F} that is exemplified by some ordinary object is @{emph \<open>not\<close>} equinumerous
to a relation @{term H} that is not exemplified by any ordinary object (proof by contradiction, since
the existence of a one-to-one correspondence@{text \<open>\<^sub>E\<close>} would imply that @{term H} is exemplified by
an ordinary object; see~\nameref{AOT:empty-approx:2}):
\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] "empty-approx:2"[of _ F H, print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}

Removing and adding ordinary objects to equinumerous properties yields equinumerous properties (see~\nameref{AOT:eqP'}):@{footnote \<open>The statements
rely on the following definition of @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[F]\<^sup>-\<^sup>x\<guillemotright>\<close>}, i.e. @{emph \<open>being an F that is not @{term x}\<close>}: @{thm "F-u"}. The proofs
rely on constructing suitable one-to-one correspondences@{text \<open>\<^sub>E\<close>} by case analysis. See TODO: cite.\<close>}

@{thm[display] eqP'[of _ F G u v, print_as_theorem]
                "P'-eq"[of _ F u G v, print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}

Properties that are equivalent on the ordinary objects (written as @{text "\<equiv>\<^sub>E"}) are equinumerous (see~\nameref{AOT:eqE},~\nameref{AOT:apE-eqE:1}):@{footnote \<open>The identity
on the ordinary objects @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>(=\<^sub>E)\<guillemotright>\<close>} can again be chosen as witness for the existence of a one-to-one-correspondence@{text \<open>\<^sub>E\<close>}.\<close>}

               "apE-eqE:1"[of _ F G, print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}
\<close>

subsection\<open>Modal Properties of Equinumerosity\<close>

text\<open>
It is noteworthy that, in general, equinumerosity is @{emph \<open>not\<close>} modally rigid. In particular, it
is provable that there are relations that are possibly equinumerous and possibly not equinumerous (see~\nameref{AOT:approx-cont:1}):

\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] "approx-cont:1"[print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}

As a simple example consider a property that is necessarily unexemplified and another property
that is @{emph \<open>actually\<close>} unexemplified, but @{emph \<open>possibly\<close>} exemplified by some ordinary object.@{footnote \<open>The
existence of such properties is guaranteed by the fact that by axiom there is an object that is not actually, but
possibly concrete as mentioned in section~\ref{AxiomSystem}.\<close>}
While such properties are equinumerous in the actual world, there is no one-to-one-correspondence@{text \<open>\<^sub>E\<close>}
between them in the possible world, in which the second property is exemplified by an object. (TODO: elaborate?)

We will see in the next section that for this reason the actual world is used as a reference for the definition
of @{emph \<open>numbering properties\<close>}.

It is noteworthy, that it is still possible to express equinumerosity relative to the behaviour of properties
in the actual world. In particular the following is a theorem (see~\nameref{AOT:approx-nec:2}):
\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] "approx-nec:2"[of _ F G, print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}

I.e. two properties @{term F} and @{term G} are equinumerous, if and only if for all properties @{term H},
both @{term F} and @{term G} are equinumerous to @{emph \<open>actually exemplifying @{term H}\<close>}.
Furthermore, for @{emph \<open>rigid\<close>} properties,@{footnote \<open>I.e. properties that are modally collapsed: @{thm "df-rigid-rel:1"[THEN "\<equiv>Df", THEN "\<equiv>S"(1), OF "cqt:2[const_var]"[axiom_inst], of _ F, rename_abs x, print_as_theorem]}\<close>}
equinumerosity is modally collapsed (see~\nameref{AOT:approx-nec:3}):
\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] "approx-nec:3"[of _ F G, print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}

The proofs of the last two theorems hinges on the existence of @{emph \<open>rigidifying\<close>} relations. Recall the
earlier discussion of this topic in section (TODO: cite) - notably, in earlier versions of PLM,
the existence of rigidifying relations had to be ensured by axiom, until further refinement
of the theory. In particular, the derivation of necessary and sufficient conditions for relations to denote
that we contributed to the theory, leads to a proof of the existence of @{emph \<open>world-indexed properties\<close>} (TODO: cite)
that can serve as witnesses for the existence of rigidifying relations, thereby eliminating the need
for the additional axiom.

\<close>




section\<open>The Number of Fs and Hume's Theorem\<close>text\<open>\label{Numbers}\<close>

text\<open>
To state Hume's Theorem additionally to the definition of @{emph \<open>equinumerosity\<close>} above,
a definition of @{emph \<open>The Number of @{term F}s\<close>} (written as @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>#F\<guillemotright>\<close>}) is required.
To that end Nodelman and Zalta (following Frege) first define what it means for an object
to number a property as follows (see~\nameref{AOT:numbers}):

\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] "numbers[den]"[THEN "\<rightarrow>E", OF "cqt:2[const_var]"[axiom_inst], of _ x G, print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}

An abstract object @{term x} numbers a property @{term G}, if it encodes exactly those properties,
such that @{emph \<open>actually exemplifying\<close>} them is equinumerous to @{term G}.
An alternative choice would be to forgo the actuality operator and merely require that @{term x}
encodes exactly those properties that are equinumerous to @{term F} itself.@{footnote \<open>In fact,
earlier constructions used this definition, but were amended in the more recent presentation
of number theory in PLM. TODO: Cite e.g. \url{http://mally.stanford.edu/Papers/numbers.pdf\<close>}.}
 However, we noted in the last section that equinumerosity is not (in general) modally rigid, so
such a definition would have the undesirable consequence that numbering properties would depend on modal context and
consequently that every possible world would need its own sets of numbers.@{footnote \<open>For a detailed
discussion of this issue refer to (TODO: cite PLM; maybe reproduce some of it here).\<close>} To avoid this
issue the actual world is used as a reference. Later in this chapter, we will show that this does
@{emph \<open>not\<close>} mean that it is impossible to count in non-actual worlds and that this definition is consistent with
the pretheoretic intuition of numbers in possible worlds (see~\ref{CountingInPossibleWorlds}). (TODO: check reference; maybe rephrase and elaborate.)

Now @{emph \<open>The Number of @{term G}s\<close>} can simply be defined as @{emph \<open>the\<close>} object that numbers
@{term G} (see~\nameref{AOT:num-def:1}):

\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] "num-def:1"}
\end{quote}

Using these definitions Nodelman and Zalta can indeed derive Hume's theorem (see~\nameref{AOT:hume:2}):

\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] "hume:2"[of F G]}
\end{quote}

Note that, due to the fact that AOT's definite descriptions are modally rigid and refer to objects
in the actual world, this theorem is not modally strict.@{footnote \<open>This is signified by the turnstile
symbol @{text "\<^bold>\<turnstile>"}. Modally-strict theorems, in contrast, are signified by @{text "\<^bold>\<turnstile>\<^sub>\<box>"}. However,
for increased readability we adopt the convention that unmarked theorems are understood to be
modally-strict. We have configured Isabelle's pretty printing accordingly. TODO: refer to earlier
discussion of this.\<close>} However, the following variants are necessary facts with modally-strict proofs (the
second translates the rigid descriptions in Hume's theorem according to Russell's analysis of
definite descriptions; see~\nameref{AOT:hume-strict:1}):

\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] "hume-strict:1"[of _ F G, print_as_theorem]}
@{thm[display] "hume-strict:2"[of _ F G, print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}

The details of this derivation are described in PLM TODO: cite and are implemented in our
embedding in TODO: cite.

text\<open>
  Given the fact that we defined numbers by means of the properties they number, which in turn is - informally
speaking - based on the number of objects those properties exemplify, a natural definition of the number zero arises.
The number zero is the object that numbers the empty property, to be more precise the number of
@{emph \<open>being a non-self-identical ordinary object\<close>} (see~\nameref{AOT:zero:1}).@{footnote \<open>To be precise being a
non-self-identical@{text \<open>\<^sub>E\<close>} object (TODO: refer to earlier section about identity@{text \<open>\<^sub>E\<close>}).
This distincation is non-trivial: While @{thm ord_eq_e_eq[of _ x, print_as_theorem]} is a theorem,
due to the hyperintensionality of object theory, it does not have to be the case that
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<lambda>x O!x & x \<noteq>\<^sub>E x]\<guillemotright>\<close>} and @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<lambda>x O!x & x \<noteq> x]\<guillemotright>\<close>} are the same property (as a matter of fact it is
not even asserted @{emph \<open>a priori\<close>} that the latter even denotes a property at all). So
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>#[\<lambda>x O!x & x \<noteq>\<^sub>E x]\<guillemotright>\<close>} and @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>#[\<lambda>x O!x & x \<noteq> x]\<guillemotright>\<close>} are not the same object
@{emph \<open>a priori\<close>}, even though it is of course a theorem that they are identical. But this theorem
has to appeal to the fact that both properties are equinumerous and to Hume's Theorem.
Further examples of terms denoting zero are @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>#[\<lambda>x x \<noteq> x]\<guillemotright>\<close>} and
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>#[\<lambda>x \<exists>p (p & \<not>p)]\<guillemotright>\<close>}. More generally, we can prove that
@{thm "0F:3"[of _ F, print_as_theorem]}, i.e. the number of any property
that's necessarily not exemplified by any ordinary object is zero (TODO: cite proof).\<close>}

@{thm[display] "zero:1"}

Note that while the above definition introduces the number zero as (abstract) object, we have not
defined the notion of a @{emph \<open>Natural Number\<close>} yet, nor shown that the number zero indeed @{emph \<open>is\<close>} a
natural number. The definition of @{emph \<open>Natural Number\<close>} will rely on introducing a @{emph \<open>predecessor\<close>}
relation and, intuitively speaking, defining that an abstract object is a natural number, if there is
a series of objects starting at zero, ending at the given abstract object, s.t. two consecutive objects
in that series bear the predecessor relation to each other. While we will describe this construction
in detail in the following sections, we can already define the strictly more general@{footnote \<open>It is
a theorem that @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>#O!\<guillemotright>\<close>} is a natural cardinal that is infinite and not a natural number. TODO: cite.\<close>} notion of a
@{emph \<open>Natural Cardinal\<close>} and it will immediately follow that zero is a natural cardinal.
An object @{term x} is a natural cardinal, just in case that there is a property @{term G},
s.t. @{term x} is the number of @{term G}s (see~\nameref{AOT:card}):

@{thm[display] card[of x]}

By the definition of the number zero, it becomes immediately apparent that zero is a natural cardinal (see~\nameref{AOT:zero-card}):

In section~\ref{Numbers}, we mentioned the use of the actual world as reference for defining numbering
properties and hinted at the fact that this is justified and consistent with pretheoretic intuition.
We can now discuss this in more detail at the example of the number Zero.

The number of a property is defined as rigid definite description
and thereby uses the actual world as frame of reference.
In particular, using the number Zero as example, this means the following (see~\nameref{AOT:0F:2}):

\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] "0F:2"[of _ F, print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}

If and only if a property @{term F} is not @{emph \<open>actually\<close>} exemplified by any ordinary object,
the number of that property is Zero. This may seem counter-intuitive at first: the stated theorem
is modally-strict and thereby a @{emph \<open>necessary\<close>} fact. So in any possible world, even in worlds
in which @{term F} could be exemplified, the number of @{term F} is still zero, if
@{term F} is not @{emph \<open>actually\<close>} exemplified. However, this is merely due to the fact that
definite descriptions are rigid and themselves refer to objects in the actual world.

Moving away from the rigidly defined @{emph \<open>number of Fs\<close>}, it is a modally-strict theorem
(and thereby a @{emph \<open>necessary\<close>} fact), that Zero @{emph \<open>numbers\<close>} any property that is not
exemplified by any ordinary object (see~\nameref{AOT:0F:1}):
\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] "0F:1"[of _ F, print_as_theorem]
               "0F:1"[THEN RN, of _ F, print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}

I.e. Zero numbers empty properties in all possible worlds. A different take on this is the
fact that any object that @{emph \<open>possibly\<close>} numbers a necessarily empty property is the number zero:
\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] ZeroRigid[of _ x, print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}

By contrast, if numbering a property had been defined without using the actual world
as reference, then "the" number Zero would be a different abstract object in different possible worlds:

If we define @{text \<open>Numbers'\<close>} without the use of the actuality operator, s.t.:
\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] NumbersAlternative'[of _ x G, print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}
Then it is a theorem that:
\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] NumbersAlternativeProp[print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}
I.e. there would be distinct abstract objects that might count necessarily empty properties.
This is clearly contrary to the pretheoretic intuition that numbers are universal, i.e. that
counting empty properties in any world will yield one and the same number Zero.

On the other hand, we can further consolidate the use of the actual world as reference frame, by
realizing that we @{emph \<open>can\<close>} talk about the numbers of properties in different worlds, despite the
rigidity of definite descriptions and the use of the actual world as reference for defining numbers.
We again use the number Zero as example and can show that if and only if a property @{term F} is not exemplified
in a given possible world @{term w}, then @{emph \<open>the number of exemplifying @{term F} at @{term w}\<close>}
is Zero (see~\nameref{AOT:0F:4}):@{footnote \<open>Recall the discussion
of AOT's theory of Possible Worlds and world-indexed properties in section TODO: cite.\<close>}

section\<open>Ancestral Relations and Transitive Closures\<close>

text\<open>
As mentioned above, @{emph \<open>Natural Numbers\<close>} will, informally speaking, be defined by the means of
series of objects that bear a (yet to be introduced) predecessor relation to each other.
However, traditionally, a series of objects relies on it being possible to index its objects using a
continuous sequence of natural numbers. Since our goal is to @{emph \<open>define\<close>} natural numbers, using
this traditional notion of a series is not an option.
Instead we construct @{emph \<open>ancestral relations\<close>}. In particular the @{emph \<open>strong ancestral\<close>} of
a relation will match the concept of the transitive closure of the relation.
Natural numbers will be defined as the objects to which the number zero bears the
@{emph \<open>weak ancestral\<close>} of the predecessor relation, i.e. the number zero itself or any
object that is transitively preceded by zero.

The first step in this process is to define being a @{emph \<open>hereditary\<close>} property with respect to
a relation, which will lead to a definition of the @{emph \<open>strong ancestral\<close>} of a relation.

\<close>

subsection\<open>Properties that are Hereditary with respect to a Relation\<close>

text\<open>
A property @{term F} is @{emph \<open>hereditary\<close>} w.r.t. a relation @{term R}, if and only if for every pair
of objects @{term x} and @{term y}, s.t. @{term x} bears @{term R} to @{term y}, if @{term x} exemplifies
@{term F}, then @{term y} exemplifies @{term F} (see~\nameref{AOT:hered:1}):

@{thm[display] "hered:1"[THEN "\<equiv>Df", THEN "\<equiv>S"(1), OF "&I", OF "cqt:2[const_var]"[axiom_inst], OF "cqt:2[const_var]"[axiom_inst], of _ F R, print_as_theorem]}


Intuitively, a relation @{term R} defines sequences of objects as follows: we call a list of
objects @{term x\<^sub>1}, ..., @{term x\<^sub>n} an @{term R}-induced sequence, if for every @{text "0 < i < n"}, 
@{term x\<^sub>i} bears @{term R} to @{text \<open>x\<^bsub>i+1\<^esub>\<close>}.
Then @{term F} being hereditary w.r.t @{term R} means that any @{term R}-induced sequence starting
in @{term F} (i.e. starting with an object exemplified by @{term F}), is completely contained in
@{term F} (i.e. every object in the sequence exemplifies @{term F} as well).

Or in other words, a property @{term F} is hereditary w.r.t a relation @{term R}, if "@{term F}-ness"
is inherited from all objects that exemplify @{term F} to the objects that are @{term R}-related to them.
\<close>

subsection\<open>Strong Ancestral of a Relation and Transitive Closures\<close>

text\<open>
Using the above definition, we can introduce the @{emph \<open>Strong Ancestral\<close>} of a relation @{term R},
which is written as @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[R]\<^sup>*\<guillemotright>\<close>} (see~\nameref{AOT:ances-df}):

@{thm[display] "ances-df"}

An object @{term x} bears @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[R]\<^sup>*\<guillemotright>\<close>} to @{term y}, just in case that @{term y} exemplifies every
property @{term F} that is hereditary w.r.t @{term R} and that is exemplified by all objects to
which @{term x} bears @{term R}.
To convince ourselves that this definition captures the transitive closure of @{term R}, we may fix
@{term x} and consider a property @{term F}, s.t. @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>\<forall>z([R]xz \<rightarrow> [F]z) & Hereditary(F,R)\<guillemotright>\<close>}.
Any such property @{term F} is exemplified by all objects immediately following @{term x} in an
@{term R}-induced sequence (first conjunct) as well as all objects in any longer @{term R}-induced
sequence starting at @{term x} (second conjunct). Hence (informally thinking of properties as sets)
any such @{term F} contains all objects that are transitively related to @{term x}. Note,
however, that @{term F} may exemplify additional objects that are not part of any @{term R}-induced
sequence. However, the intersection of all such properties @{term F} yields the smallest set of
objects that are transitively related to @{term x}, which is @{emph \<open>exactly\<close>} those objects that
@{emph \<open>are\<close>} transitively related to @{term x}.

It is interesting to note that there is a different way to define the transitive closure of
a relation @{term R}, that occurs more commonly in traditional mathematical training, namely:

The transitive closure of a relation @{term R} is the intersection of all transitive relations @{term R'} that
are contained in @{term R}.
As a matter of fact we can state this definition in AOT as well, and prove it to be equivalent to
the strong ancestral of @{term R}.

First we define being transitive for a relation as follows:
\<close>

AOT_define Transitive :: \<open>\<tau> \<Rightarrow> \<phi>\<close> (\<open>Transitive'(_')\<close>)
  \<open>Transitive(R) \<equiv>\<^sub>d\<^sub>f \<forall>x\<forall>y\<forall>z([R]xy & [R]yz \<rightarrow> [R]xz)\<close>

text\<open>
Next we can define for a relation to be contained in another relation, or alternatively, moving
away from set-theoretic concepts, for a relation to entail another relation:
\<close>

AOT_define Entails :: \<open>\<tau> \<Rightarrow> \<tau> \<Rightarrow> \<phi>\<close> (\<open>Entails'(_,_')\<close>)
  \<open>Entails(R,R') \<equiv>\<^sub>d\<^sub>f \<forall>x\<forall>y([R]xy \<rightarrow> [R']xy)\<close>

text\<open>
Being in the intersection of all transitive relations entailed by @{term R} means exemplifying
all of them. Hence we can define the transitive closure of @{term R} as follows:
\<close>

AOT_define TransitiveClosure :: \<open>\<tau> \<Rightarrow> \<Pi>\<close> (\<open>TransitiveClosure'(_')\<close>)
  \<open>TransitiveClosure(R) =\<^sub>d\<^sub>f [\<lambda>xy \<forall>R'(Transitive(R') & Entails(R,R') \<rightarrow> [R']xy)]\<close>

text\<open>
Now we can prove that this definition of a transitive closure is equivalent to the definition
of a strong ancestral above:

section\<open>Weak Ancestral of a Relation and the Non-Existence of a General Relation of Identity\<close>

text\<open>
As mentioned above the goal is to define being a Natural Number as either being Zero or being an
object, s.t. Zero bears the strong ancestral of the to-be-defined predecessor relation to it.
This matches the notion of the @{emph \<open>weak ancestral\<close>} of the predecessor relation. Traditionally
(TODO: cite Frege), the weak ancestral of a relation @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[R]\<^sup>+\<guillemotright>\<close>} is defined, s.t. an object @{term x}
bears @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[R]\<^sup>+\<guillemotright>\<close>} to an object @{term y}, if and only if either @{term x} bears the strong ancestral
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[R]\<^sup>*\<guillemotright>\<close>} to @{term y} or @{term \<open>x = y\<close>}.

However, in AOT there is no general relation of identity, i.e. @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<lambda>xy x = y]\<guillemotright>\<close>} does not
denote (TODO: refer to earlier discussion about this TBD). Consequently, the immediate candidate
for defining the weak ancestral of a relation @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<lambda>xy [R]\<^sup>*xy \<or> x = y]\<guillemotright>\<close>} provable does not denote
for any @{term R} with a strong ancestral that is not reflexive:@{footnote \<open>For trivial relations
@{term R}, e.g. for a relation @{term R} that is universally exemplified, the @{text \<open>\<lambda>\<close>}-expression
in question does trivially denote. Having a non-reflexive strong ancestral on the other hand is

the strong ancestral of the predecessor relation is not reflexive.\<close>}

@{term R} to the same object @{term z}, then @{term x} and @{term y} are identical (see~\nameref{AOT:df-1-1:1}):

@{thm[display] "df-1-1:1"[THEN "\<equiv>Df", THEN "\<equiv>S"(1), OF "cqt:2[const_var]"[axiom_inst], of _ R, print_as_theorem]}

Note, however, that one-to-one relations are more general than injective functions, since the criterion
to be one-to-one does not imply that the relation is @{emph \<open>functional\<close>}, i.e. that each object
in its domain is related to exactly one object.

An object @{term x} is in the domain of a relation @{term R}, just in case that there is an
object @{term y}, s.t. @{term x} bears @{term R} to @{term y} (see~\nameref{AOT:df-1-1:5}):

@{thm[display] "df-1-1:5"[of x R, THEN "\<equiv>Df", print_as_theorem]}

While the predecessor relation will in fact be a functional relation, a relation that
relates a single object to all other objects, but no other object to any object, is an example of a
one-to-one relation that's succinctly non-functional.

However, in order to introduce a restricted notion of identity, functionality is not a requirement.
But the restricted identity we are about to define only makes sense for one-to-one relation. For that reason, we
introduce restricted variables for them and only define the restricted identity relative
to this restriction. Reasoning with non-rigid restricted variables, however, is cumbersome (TODO: cite discussion in PLM or 
sections above), so we define @{emph \<open>rigid one-to-one relations\<close>} as relations that are both one-to-one and rigid (we
restate the definition of rigid as well) (see~\nameref{AOT:df-rigid-rel:1},~\nameref{AOT:df-1-1:2}): (TODO: refer to earlier mentions of rigidity)

@{thm[display] "df-rigid-rel:1"[THEN "\<equiv>Df", THEN "\<equiv>S"(1), OF "cqt:2[const_var]"[axiom_inst], of _ R, print_as_theorem]}
@{thm[display] "df-1-1:2"[THEN "\<equiv>Df", of _ R, print_as_theorem]}

In the following we will use @{term \<R>} as a restricted variable ranging over rigid one-to-one relations.@{footnote \<open>Note
that AOT uses $\underline{R}$, however, in our framework choosing a fresh symbol @{term \<R>} is simpler for technical reasons.\<close>}

For a variable @{term \<R>} that is restricted to rigid one-to-one relations, a restricted notion
of identity can now be defined as follows (see~\nameref{AOT:id-d-R}):

@{thm[display] "id-d-R"}

Note that in contrast to general identity, @{term \<R>}-identity (trivially) is a proper relation.

By @{text \<beta>}-conversion and using infix notation, two objects @{term x} and @{term y} are
@{term \<R>}-identical, if there is an object to which they are both @{term \<R>}-related (see~\nameref{AOT:id-R-thm:1}):

@{thm[display] "id-R-thm:1"[of _ \<R> x y, print_as_theorem]}

Since @{term \<R>} is restricted to rigid one-to-one relations, the resulting identity relation is exactly the
restriction of general identity to the domain of @{term \<R>}:

@{thm[display] r_id_restr[of _ \<R> x y, print_as_theorem]}

Consequently, the defined identity is a partial equivalence relation that is

Based on the concept of @{term \<R>}-identity, Nodelman and Zalta continue to define the @{emph \<open>weak ancestral\<close>} of a
relation @{term \<open>\<R>\<^sup>+\<close>} for rigid one-to-one relations as follows (see~\nameref{AOT:w-ances-df}):

@{thm[display] "w-ances-df"}

Restricting to the domain of @{term \<R>}, two object are now exactly in the weak ancestral relation
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<R>]\<^sup>+\<guillemotright>\<close>}, if they are either transitively @{term \<R>}-related (i.e. in the strong ancestral
relation @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<R>]\<^sup>*\<guillemotright>\<close>}) or identical:

@{thm[display] ances_in_domain[of _ x \<R> y, print_as_theorem]}

In other words, the weak ancestral of a relation is its transitive and reflexive closure.
\<close>

section\<open>Generalized Induction\<close>

text\<open>
In order to understand the formulation of generalized induction, first consider the
following theorem that Nodelman and Zalta prove before even introducing weak ancestral relations,
but which already has "inductive character" (see~\nameref{AOT:anc-her:3}):

@{thm[display] "anc-her:3"[of _ F x R y, print_as_theorem]}

While this may not look like an inductive principle as stated, unfolding the definition of
@{text \<open>Hereditary\<close>}, this is equivalent (under some trivial transformations) to the following:
\<close>

AOT_theorem pre_ind': \<open>[F]z & \<forall>x\<forall>y([R]xy \<rightarrow> ([F]x \<rightarrow> [F]y)) \<rightarrow> \<forall>y ([R]\<^sup>*zy \<rightarrow> [F]y)\<close>

  AOT_assume \<open>[F]z & \<forall>x\<forall>y([R]xy \<rightarrow> ([F]x \<rightarrow> [F]y))\<close>
  AOT_hence \<open>[F]z & Hereditary(F,R)\<close>
    by (AOT_subst_def "hered:1") (auto intro!: "&I" "cqt:2" elim: "&E")
  moreover AOT_assume \<open>[R]\<^sup>*zy\<close>
  moreover AOT_have \<open>[F]z & [R\<^sup>*]zy & Hereditary(F,R) \<rightarrow> [F]y\<close>
    using "anc-her:3". \<comment> \<open>This is an instance of the theorem cited above.\<close>
  ultimately AOT_show \<open>[F]y\<close>
    using "&I" "&E" "\<rightarrow>E" by metis
qed

text\<open>
I.e. if an object @{term z} exemplifies @{term F} and @{term F} is inherited via @{term R}, then
any object that is transitively @{term R}-related to @{term z} exemplifies @{term F}.

Pretend for a moment that @{term R} was a well-defined predecessor relation and @{term z} the number zero.
Then this theorem would imply that if (1) @{term F} holds for Zero and
(2) for any @{term x} and @{term y}, s.t. @{term x} precedes @{term y}, if @{term x} exemplifies
@{term F}, then @{term y} exemplifies @{term F}, then @{term F} holds for all numbers transitively
preceded by Zero (and since @{term F} also holds for Zero by assumption this would trivially imply that
@{term F} holds for any natural number).

In principle, this is how mathematical induction will be derived.
However, it is inconvenient that the induction step in this formulation ranges over the full domain
of all objects. When arguing about an induction step, it is counter-intuitive to consider if and
in what way natural numbers may or may not be related to arbitrary objects.
By instantiating @{term F} to @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<lambda>x [F]x & [\<R>]\<^sup>+zx]\<guillemotright>\<close>}, the above can be
generalized to the following principle, which PLM states as @{emph \<open>Generalized Induction\<close>}
(TODO cite; see~\nameref{AOT:pre-ind}):@{footnote \<open>Note that (1) @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<R>]\<^sup>+zy\<guillemotright>\<close>} for any @{term y}
implies @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<R>]\<^sup>+zz\<guillemotright>\<close>}, yielding @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<lambda>x [F]x & [\<R>]\<^sup>+zx]z\<guillemotright>\<close>} in all cases in which the consequent
of the strengthened theorem does not trivially hold (i.e. if @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>\<not>\<exists>y [\<R>]\<^sup>+zy\<guillemotright>\<close>}) and (2) that the consequent of
the weaker theorem can be strengthened since @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<R>]\<^sup>+zy\<guillemotright>\<close>} either
 implies (a) @{term \<open>z = y\<close>}, in which case @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[F]y\<guillemotright>\<close>} follows from the assumption @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[F]z\<guillemotright>\<close>},
or it implies (b) @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<R>]\<^sup>*zy\<guillemotright>\<close>}, in which case the consequent of the weaker principle yields @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[F]y\<guillemotright>\<close>}.
The additional fact that @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<R>]xy\<guillemotright>\<close>} and @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<R>]\<^sup>+zx\<guillemotright>\<close>} imply @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<R>]\<^sup>+zy\<guillemotright>\<close>} is sufficient to
arrive at the strengthened theorem.\<close>}

@{thm[display] "pre-ind"[of _ F z \<R>, print_as_theorem]}

We will show below that instantiating this generalized principle of induction to the predecessor relation
we are about to define, yields classical mathematical induction (relative to a defined notion of natural numbers).

Note, however, that while the predecessor relation will define a total order on its domain, the
generalized principle of induction can be applied more broadly: We say that an object is @{emph \<open>part of
the @{term \<R>}-series starting at @{term z}\<close>}, just in case it either is identical to @{term z} or transitively @{term \<R>}-related to @{term z}.
Then generalized induction shows that all objects on the @{term \<R>}-series
starting at @{term z} exemplify @{term F} just in case, @{term z} exemplifies @{term F} and
@{term F} is inherited from any object on an @{term \<R>}-series starting at @{term z} to any other such object
to which it is @{term \<R>}-related. TODO: try to make the generality clearer; applicability beyond total orders.
\<close>

section\<open>The Predecessor Relation\<close>

subsection\<open>Definition\<close>

text\<open>
While the definition of the predecessor relation is rather straightforward, the interesting question
will be whether it actually denotes a relation, which we will discuss in detail below. For the moment
assume that the @{text \<open>\<lambda>\<close>}-expression in the definiens of the following definition
denotes (see~\nameref{AOT:pred-thm:1}):\footnote{Note that PLM uses the symbol $\mathbb{P}$ for
the predecessor relation instead.}

@{thm[display] "pred-thm:1"}


Given the assumption that this relation denotes, it follows by @{text \<open>\<beta>\<close>}-conversion that (see~\nameref{AOT:pred-thm:3}):

@{thm[display] "pred-thm:3"[of _ x y, print_as_theorem]}

So an object @{term x} precedes an object @{term y} just in case there is a property @{term F}
and an ordinary object @{term u}, s.t. @{term u} exemplifies @{term F}, @{term y} numbers @{term F}
and @{term x} numbers being an @{term F} other than @{term u}  (via the definition @{thm "F-u"}).

This is a variant of Frege's definition of the successor relation (TODO cite)@{footnote \<open>Nodelman and
Zalta argue in favour of a predecessor relation due to the fact that in contrast to a successor relation,
the argument order of the predecessor relation matches the numerical order of objects in the relation.
Otherwise the notions are interchangeable, i.e. @{text \<open>Succeeds(y,x)\<close>} is exactly @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<P>]xy\<guillemotright>\<close>}.\<close>}.
The idea can be clarified by considering how the first natural numbers are related w.r.t this relation:
\<^item> The number Zero numbers properties that are not (actually) exemplified by any ordinary object. Hence there
  cannot be a property @{term F} that is exemplified by an object @{term u}, s.t. Zero numbers @{term F},
  which means that Zero is not preceded by any object.
\<^item> The number One numbers properties that are (actually) exemplified by a single ordinary object.@{footnote \<open>While
  we have not formally introduced any number other than Zero, we consider this intuitive understanding helpful
  in clarifying the idea of the predecessor relation. The number One will formally be introduced later in this chapter.\<close>}
  Hence any property @{term F} numbered by One is exemplified
  by some ordinary object @{term \<open>u\<close>}. Furthermore, @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[F]\<^sup>-\<^sup>u\<guillemotright>\<close>}, i.e. being an object exemplifying @{term F} other than @{term u},
  is not exemplified by any ordinary object. Hence Zero is the unique predecessor of One.
\<^item> The number Two numbers properties that are (actually) exemplified by two distinct ordinary objects.
  Being an object that exemplifies any of these properties other than any particular object the given
  property exemplifies, is a property exemplified by only one ordinary object, hence numbered by One, i.e.
  One preceeds Two, etc.
\<close>


subsection\<open>Assuring that the Predecessor Relation Denotes\<close>text\<open>\label{pred-denotes}\<close>

text\<open>
It is important to realize that the @{text \<open>\<lambda>\<close>}-expression used in above definition does not
trivially denote a relation in AOT.
@{emph \<open>Numbering a property\<close>} is an encoding claim: an object numbers a property @{term G}, just in case
it encodes all properties, s.t. actually exemplifying it is equinumerous to @{term G}.
In general, encoding claims cannot be abstracted to denoting properties and relations (TODO: cite earlier discussion
on this).

In fact it is easy to see that the minimal model of AOT does not validate this axiom: the minimal
model contains one ordinary urelement (resp. one ordinary object) and one special urelement.
Since special urelements determine the exemplification extensions of abstract objects, there being
only one special urelement implies that all abstract objects exemplify the same properties and relations.
This implies in particular that either all objects are preceded by zero or no object is, in particular:
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<P>]0 0\<guillemotright>\<close>} or @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>\<not>\<exists>x [\<P>]0 x\<guillemotright>\<close>}. However, we have already (informally) argued above that zero is
not preceded by any object.@{footnote \<open>Both @{thm "no-pred-0:1"[print_as_theorem]} and @{thm "prec-facts:1"[print_as_theorem]} are formally 
derived TODO: cite.\<close>} Hence in this model it would have to hold that @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>\<not>\<exists>x [\<P>]0 x\<guillemotright>\<close>}.
However, since the minimal model still contains one ordinary object, the number One can be constructed
and (again as argued above) is preceded by Zero, i.e. @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<P>]0 1\<guillemotright>\<close>}, which yields a contradiction.

Nodelman and Zalta assert that the predecessor relation denotes by axiom and emphasize that the relation
is not inherently mathematical and no mathematical primitives are needed to assert as an axiom that
it denotes. (TODO cite PLM: pred). On the one hand they argue that expressions of the form
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>Numbers(y,F)\<guillemotright>\<close>}, while seemingly mathematical in nature, can be eliminated, since they are @{emph \<open>defined\<close>}
in terms of primitives of AOT. On the other hand they argue that the relation merely asserts the
existence of an ordering relation on abstract objects and ordering relations can in general be expressed in
entirely logical terms.

However, even if one concedes that the axiom is not inherently mathematical, it can be objected
that it is rather @{emph \<open>ad-hoc\<close>}: rather than asserting a general principle according to which
encoding claims can be abstracted to relations, it singles out a specific relation and this
relation is, after all, used to @{emph \<open>define\<close>} a concept that is very much mathematical in nature.
Furthermore, the axiom is not trivially consistent: as we have already shown minimal models of the
base system of AOT do not validate it.

Using our embedding we can, however, contribute to this situation in two ways:
  \<^item> We can show that the axiom is consistent by constructing models that validate it.
  \<^item> We can generalize the axiom to a comprehension principle for relations among abstract objects, s.t.
    it becomes a theorem that the predecessor relation in particular denotes. We are confident that
    we can thereby alleviate any remaining doubt on the non-mathematical character of the axiom.

We defer our more detailed discussion of this axiom to section~\ref{pred} and in the following continue to
reproduce the construction of Natural Numbers and Mathematical Induction as given by Nodelman and Zalta
in PLM.
\<close>

subsection\<open>The Predecessor Relation as Rigid One-to-One Relation.\<close>

text\<open>
It can be derived that the Predecessor Relation is Rigid: @{thm "pred-1-1:2"[print_as_theorem]}
respectively @{thm "pred-1-1:1"[of _ x y,print_as_theorem]}.
While the full proof can be found in (TODO: cite), it is noteworthy that it again (TODO: adjust depending
on whether rigidifying relations end up being discussed above in the context of equinumerosity) requires
to argue with @{emph \<open>rigidifying\<close>} relations: by the theorem governing the predecessor relation given above,
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<P>]xy\<guillemotright>\<close>} implies that there exists a relation @{term F} and an ordinary object @{term u}, s.t.
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[F]u & Numbers(y, F) & Numbers(x,[F]\<^sup>-\<^sup>u)\<guillemotright>\<close>}. However, none of the conjuncts are guaranteed to
be necessary. But we may refer to the fact that for any relation @{term F} there exists a relation @{term G}
that @{emph \<open>rigidifies\<close>} @{term F} and this relation @{term G} can serve as witness for the claim that
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>\<box>[\<P>]xy\<guillemotright>\<close>}.

Furthermore, it is a consequence of a modally-strict variant of Hume's principle that the predecessor
relation is one-to-one (see~\nameref{AOT:pred-1-1:3}): @{thm "pred-1-1:3"[print_as_theorem]}.

Consequently, the Predecessor Relation is a rigid one-to-one relation and we can instantiate
the definition of the @{emph \<open>strong\<close>} ancestral to @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>\<P>\<guillemotright>\<close>} (see~\nameref{AOT:assume-anc:1}):

@{thm[display] "assume-anc:1"[print_as_theorem]}

Furthermore, being @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>\<P>\<guillemotright>\<close>}-identical as well as the @{emph \<open>weak\<close>} ancestral of @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>\<P>\<guillemotright>\<close>} are also well-defined (see~\nameref{AOT:assume1:2}):

@{thm[display] "assume1:2"[of _ x y, print_as_theorem] "assume1:3"[print_as_theorem]}

Before we continue to define Natural Numbers, it is noteworthy that it is already derivable that
the number Zero neither has a direct nor a transitive predecessor (see~\nameref{AOT:no-pred-0:1}): @{thm "no-pred-0:1"[print_as_theorem]}
respectively @{thm "no-pred-0:2"[print_as_theorem]}
\<close>

section\<open>Natural Numbers\<close>

text\<open>

Using the infrastructure introduced in the past section, we can now follow through with the strategy
described in the beginning of the chapter and define @{emph \<open>being a natural number\<close>} as being an
object, s.t. Zero bears the weak ancestral of the Predecessor relation to it (see~\nameref{AOT:nnumber:1}):

@{thm[display] "nnumber:1"}

Since by construction the weak ancestral of any rigid one-to-one relation denotes a proper relation,
it follows that @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>\<nat>\<guillemotright>\<close>} denotes a property @{thm "nnumber:2"[print_as_theorem]} (see~\nameref{AOT:nnumber:2}) and consequently by
@{text \<open>\<beta>\<close>}-conversion that (see~\nameref{AOT:nnumber:3}):

@{thm[display] "nnumber:3"[of _ x, print_as_theorem]}
\<close>

section\<open>Zero is a Natural Number\<close>

text\<open>

The first Dedekind-Peano postulate can now be derived (see~\nameref{AOT:0-n}):

@{thm[display] "0-n"[print_as_theorem]}

Interestingly, while both in Frege's original work and in Zalta's first construction (TODO: cite both)
the weak ancestral was defined using general identity and consequently @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<P>]\<^sup>+0 0\<guillemotright>\<close>} is a simple
consequence of the fact that zero is self-identical, due to the construction via rigid one-to-one relations
this theorem requires a non-trivial proof: @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<P>]\<^sup>+0 0\<guillemotright>\<close>} by definition is just the case if either
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<P>]\<^sup>*0 0\<guillemotright>\<close>} (which was already refuted above) or @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>0 =\<^sub>\<P> 0\<guillemotright>\<close>}.

However, @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>0 =\<^sub>\<P> 0\<guillemotright>\<close>} is not a simple consequence of the fact that @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>0 = 0\<guillemotright>\<close>}, but additionally
requires that @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>InDomainOf(0,\<P>)\<guillemotright>\<close>}, respectively that @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>\<exists>y [\<P>]0 y\<guillemotright>\<close>}, i.e. the proof
effectively requires to construct the number One as witness.@{footnote \<open>The number One can for example
be introduced as the number of any relation exemplified by exactly one ordinary object.
Since it is a theorem (see~\nameref{AOT:o-objects-exist:1}) that there is an ordinary object @{thm "o-objects-exist:1"[THEN "qml:2"[axiom_inst, THEN "\<rightarrow>E"], print_as_theorem]},
we can choose @{term a} to be a witness to this existential claim and choose @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>#[\<lambda>x O!x & x =\<^sub>E a]\<guillemotright>\<close>} as a witness
to @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>\<exists>y [\<P>]0 y\<guillemotright>\<close>}. TODO: cite full proof.\<close>}

This constitutes one of the corrections to the construction that can be traced back directly to
the embedding. Preliminary working versions of the chapter of PLM left this non-trivial proof
as an exercise referring to it being a trivial consequence of the self-identity of the number Zero.
Trying to prove the statement in the embedding showed that additional work is required due to the
changes in the construction compared to previous versions and we could suggest the proof outlined in the footnote.
TODO: think about whether to emphasize this that much or adding something like "Even though to be fair the chapter was
under heavy revision at the time and this omission would likely have been independently uncovered eventually".

section\<open>Being a Natural Number is Rigid\<close>

From the generalized principle of induction when instantiating @{term F} to @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<lambda>x \<box>[\<nat>]x]\<guillemotright>\<close>}
and @{term \<R>} to @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>\<P>\<guillemotright>\<close>}, it follows that @{thm "mod-col-num:1"[of _ x, print_as_theorem]}
and consequently that @{thm "mod-col-num:2"[print_as_theorem]} (see~\nameref{AOT:mod-col-num:1},~\nameref{AOT:mod-col-num:2}).

Since furthermore Zero is a witness to the existence of natural numbers and it is easy to prove
that @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<nat>]\<kappa> \<rightarrow> \<kappa>\<down>\<guillemotright>\<close>}, @{emph \<open>being a natural number\<close>} is a @{emph \<open>rigid restriction condition\<close>} and

section\<open>Zero Has No Predecessor\<close>

text\<open>
We have already mentioned the fact that @{thm "no-pred-0:1"[print_as_theorem]} above, but we can
now restate this theorem @{emph \<open>a fortiori\<close>} for variables restricted to natural numbers, which
constitutes the second Dedkind-Peano postulate (as mentioned above this formulation is equivalent to
the assertion that Zero is not the successor of any natural number; see~\nameref{AOT:0-pred}):

section\<open>No Two Natural Numbers have the Same Successor\<close>

text\<open>
The third Dedekind-Peano postulate is a general property of any one-to-one relation, but can
be stated explicitly using restricted variables for natural numbers (on which @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>\<P>\<guillemotright>\<close>}-identity
matches general identity) as follows (see~\nameref{AOT:no-same-succ}):

@{thm[display] "no-same-succ"[print_as_theorem]}

section\<open>Mathematical Induction\<close>text\<open>\label{MathematicalInduction}\<close>

text\<open>
As promised at the beginning of the chapter we can now derive Mathematical Induction as follows (see~\nameref{AOT:induction}):

@{thm induction[print_as_theorem]}

If a property is (1) satisfied on the number zero and (2) being satisfied on a
natural number implies it being satisfied for its successor, then that property is true for all natural numbers.

TODO: cite full proof or just quickly state that it's a special case of generalized induction?

Thereby the fifth Dedekind-Peano postulate is derivable (TODO: check where the numbering is actually coming from and cite).
Note, however, that we haven't yet derived the fourth Dedekind-Peano axiom, i.e. every Natural Number has a unique successor.
The construction so far is validated by the minimal models of AOT that are extended to validate the Predecessor Axiom.
Validating the Predecessor Axiom involves increasing the number of special urelements in the model (see~\ref{pred}; TODO: adjust reference, if necessary),
but it does not require to increase the number of ordinary urelements/objects, so there are still
models with only a single ordinary urelement/object. However, in such models the only natural numbers
are Zero and One and the number One will not have a successor.
For that reason, Nodelman and Zalta extend the system by another axiom, which we will discuss below
after stating a few more derived properties of the predecessor relation and natural numbers.

We note a few more interesting properties of natural numbers and the predecessor relation that can
be derived from the construction thus far.

Successors of natural numbers are (transitively) natural numbers (see~\nameref{AOT:suc-num:1}):

@{thm[display] "suc-num:1"[of _ n x, print_as_theorem]
               "suc-num:2"[of _ n x, print_as_theorem]
               "suc-num:3"[of _ n x, print_as_theorem]}

Predecessors of natural numbers are (transivitely) natural numbers (see~\nameref{AOT:pred-num}):@{footnote \<open>PLM proves only the
first.\<close>}

@{thm[display] "pred-num"[of _ x n, print_as_theorem]
               "pred-num[ext1]"[of _ x n, print_as_theorem]
               "pred-num[ext2]"[of _ x n, print_as_theorem]}

Natural numbers are Natural Cardinals (see~\nameref{AOT:nat-card}):

@{thm[display] "nat-card"[of _ x, print_as_theorem]}

The Predecessor relation is functional (see~\nameref{AOT:pred-func:1}):

@{thm[display] "pred-func:1"[of _ x y z, print_as_theorem]
               "pred-func:2"[of _ n m k, print_as_theorem]}
\<close>

section\<open>Possible Richness of Objects\<close>

text\<open>
As mentioned above, the construction so far is valid in models with only a single ordinary 
object/urelement and consequently with only two natural numbers, which is not sufficient to
derive that every natural number has a successor.

The following axiom, by which Nodelman and Zalta proceed to extend the system, changes this (see~\nameref{AOT:modal-axiom}):

@{thm[display] "modal-axiom"[axiom_inst, of _ G, print_as_theorem]}

If there is a natural number which numbers @{term G}, then there might have been a concrete object
@{term y} which is distinct from every ordinary object that @{emph \<open>actually\<close>} exemplifies @{term G}
(TODO: cite).
We will explain in detail how we extend our models to be able to validate this axiom in section~\ref{modell-modal-axiom}.
In summary the axiom requires extending the domain of ordinary urelements/objects to an at least
countably infinite set (while there may still only be a single @{emph \<open>concrete\<close>} object).

This axiom requires some justification, especially given the claim that the construction is
@{emph \<open>purely logical\<close>} and does not require to presuppose any intrinsically mathematical claims.

Traditionally, a system is no longer considered to be @{emph \<open>purely logical\<close>}, if it asserts the existence
of more than one object. While Nodelman and Zalta agree with this principle, they argue that
it only extends to @{emph \<open>concrete\<close>} objects.
While above axiom does imply that the domain of @{emph \<open>ordinary\<close>} objects (recall that @{emph \<open>being ordinary\<close>}
is defined as @{emph \<open>being @{emph \<open>possibly\<close>} concrete\<close>}) is at least countably infinite, it does not imply
that there is even a single object that is @{emph \<open>actually concrete\<close>}.
Nodelman and Zalta further argue that on the one hand it is in fact common for logical systems to assert the existence
of more than one @{emph \<open>abstract\<close>} object, for example that there are two distinct truth values, The
True and The False (TODO: cite PLM and maybe Frege), and that on the other hand logicians traditionally
work under the assumption that @{emph \<open>the domain of objects @{emph \<open>might\<close>} be of any size\<close>}, which
they take as a modal claim: while logic may not presuppose that the domain of concrete object
has any particular size, it allows for the @{emph \<open>possiblity\<close>} of the domain being of any size, i.e.
it is valid for a logic to presuppose that there @{emph \<open>may possibly\<close>} be more than one object, as
long as that does not imply that there is @{emph \<open>actually\<close>} more than one (concrete) object.

Independently of the question whether this axiom may or may not be considered as @{emph \<open>purely logical\<close>},
towards which we refrain from presuming to pass judgement either way, we certainly agree that it captures a pretheoretic
intuition: it is a prerequisite of talking about natural numbers to be able to imagine that
no matter how many objects we currently consider that there @{emph \<open>possibly might have been\<close>} yet another object,
even though for doing so we do not need to be able to point to this object in the actual world (i.e. it may not be concrete, but
merely @{emph \<open>possibly concrete\<close>}). (TODO: rephrase and improve this entire discussion)


\<close>

section\<open>Every Number has a Unique Successor\<close>

text\<open>
The above axiom is now sufficient to derive the last Dedekind-Peano postulate, i.e. that every
natural number has a unique successor (see~\nameref{AOT:th-succ}):

@{thm[display] "th-succ"[print_as_theorem]}

While PLM continues to derive further theorems of Number Theory, defines mathematical
functions and operations, including recursively defined functions such as addition and proceeds to
derive Second-Order Dedekind-Peano arithmetic,@{footnote \<open>In the future, we hope to be able to
provide a full implementation of this chapter of PLM relative to our embedding.\<close>} we will conclude
our discussion of the topic here and instead discuss in more detail how we modelled the two required
axioms introduced in the last sections in our models and our implementation.
\<close>


section\<open>The Predecessor Axiom in Detail\<close>text\<open>\label{pred}\<close>

text\<open>
Recall that the predecessor axiom of PLM is stated as follows (see~\nameref{AOT:pred}):

\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] pred[print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}

In section~\ref{pred-denotes} we have already established that the relation in question
distinguishes between certain abstract objects that number properties and that this relation
does @{emph \<open>not\<close>} denote in the minimal models of the base system of AOT. We also have already
discussed that there cannot be a relation in AOT that generally distinguishes between arbitrary abstract
objects (in particular @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<lambda>xy x = y]\<guillemotright>\<close>} does not denote; TODO: cite). So we want to determine
what is special about the abstract objects that @{emph \<open>are\<close>} distinguished by the predecessor relation
that allows to construct consistent models for it.

To that end, we first note that if @{emph \<open>numbering a property\<close>} denotes a property, the
predecessor relation denotes by coexistence, since then, using @{text \<open>\<beta>\<close>}-conversion, the matrix
of the predecessor relation is necessarily universally equivalent to
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<lambda>xy \<exists>F \<exists>u ([F]u & [\<lambda>z Numbers(z,F)]y & [\<lambda>z Numbers(z,[F]\<^sup>-\<^sup>u)]x)]\<guillemotright>\<close>}, which denotes axiomatically.
(TODO: cite full proof in appendix or insert full proof here)

We can indeed construct models in which @{thm numbers_prop_den[of _ F, print_as_theorem]} is
a theorem (see~\nameref{AOT:AOT_NaturalNumbers.numbers_prop_den}).
Recall that @{emph \<open>numbering a property\<close>} is equivalent to the following condition (see~\nameref{AOT:numbers[den]}):

\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] "numbers[den]"[THEN "\<rightarrow>E", OF "cqt:2[const_var]"[axiom_inst], of _ x G, print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}

So while @{emph \<open>numbering a property\<close>} is a condition on the properties an abstract object encodes,
it requires the abstract object to encode an entire class of properties, namely all properties, s.t.
@{emph \<open>actually\<close>} exemplifying them is equinumerous to the numbered property. Further recall that
being @{emph \<open>equinumerous\<close>}, informally speaking, means to be exemplified by the same amount of
@{emph \<open>ordinary\<close>} objects.

This is the crucial fact that allows us to construct suitable models: while we need to distinguish
between abstract objects based on the properties they @{emph \<open>encode\<close>}, the condition under which these
abstract objects encode or do not encode properties solely relies on the exemplification patterns of 
those properties on the @{emph \<open>ordinary\<close>} objects.

In our models, two abstract objects are exemplification-distinguishable, if they are mapped to distinct
@{emph \<open>special urelements\<close>}. If we wanted to be able to distinguish between abstract objects
in general based on the exemplification patterns of the properties they encode, this would mean that
@{emph \<open>special urelements\<close>} would need to be defined self-referentially. Exemplification patterns
are functions from @{emph \<open>urelements\<close>} (i.e. ordinary @{emph \<open>and\<close>} special urlements) to modal
truth conditions (i.e. functions from semantic possible worlds to booleans).

Therefore, if we wanted to assign distinct special urelements based on @{emph \<open>general\<close>} exemplification
patterns, we would need an injective function from exemplification patterns (i.e. sets of functions
acting on urelements) to special urelements, which would be in violation of Cantor's theorem. (TODO: cite?)

However, fortunately, we only need to distinguish between exemplification patterns on @{emph \<open>ordinary\<close>}
objects. Since the domains of special urelements and ordinary urelements are independent, it is
consistently possible to require there being an injective function mapping any kind of function
(or sets of functions) acting on ordinary urelements alone to special urelements.

In our general models we chose an @{emph \<open>abstract\<close>} type @{typ \<sigma>} as type of special urelements.@{footnote \<open>I.e.
we allow any non-empty domain for @{typ \<sigma>} in models of the meta-logic without restriction.\<close>}
In our extended models that validate the predecessor axiom, we instead @{emph \<open>define\<close>} a concrete
type by choosing a subset of the sets of type @{typ \<open>(\<omega> \<Rightarrow> w \<Rightarrow> bool) set \<times> (\<omega> \<Rightarrow> w \<Rightarrow> bool) set \<times> \<sigma>'\<close>}
as representation set for @{typ \<sigma>}.
Recall that the type @{typ \<omega>} is the type of ordinary urelements and @{typ w} is the type of
semantic possible worlds. @{typ \<sigma>'} is an additional abstract type of @{emph \<open>very special urelements\<close>}
that retains the model's ability to distinguish between abstract objects beyond those that
differ in exemplification patterns on the ordinary objects.
So in these models, special urelements are tuples of two copies of sets of property extensions on
ordinary objects and a very special urelements. We refer to the first copy of extensions as the
@{emph \<open>intersection set of ordinary property extensions\<close>} and to the second copy as the
@{emph \<open>union set of ordinary property extensions\<close>}.

When we map an abstract object @{term a} to this new type of special urelements,
we insert a property extension on ordinary objects into the intersection set, just in case 
@{term a} encodes @{emph \<open>all\<close>} properties with this extension on the ordinary objects.
And we insert an extension into the union set, just in case that there @{emph \<open>exists\<close>}
a property with that extension (on the ordinary objects) that is encoded by @{term a}.

To retain the surjectivity of the mapping from abstract objects to special urelements (TODO: cite explanation
of this requirement), we need to impose further restrictions on the representation set of special urelements.
In particular:
  \<^item> Whenever an extension on the ordinary objects is in the intersection set, it also has
    to be in the union set.
  \<^item> We choose a designated @{emph \<open>very special urelement\<close>} @{term \<open>\<sigma>'\<^sub>0\<close>} for the case that the union set is identical
    to the intersection set.
    In this case the abstract object encodes @{emph \<open>exactly\<close>} those properties with an extension on
    the ordinary objects that is contained in either of the (identical) extension sets. For each such set of
    extensions, there is a single unique such abstract object, therefore we can only assign a single
    unique special urelement to this case.

This construction @{emph \<open>forces\<close>} two abstract objects to be assigned different special urelements,
in case either (1) one of them encodes a property with a given extension on the ordinary object, while the other doesn't
encode any such property, or (2) one of them encodes all properties with a given extension on the ordinary object,
while the other fails to encode at least one such property.

Furthermore, the construction still @{emph \<open>allows\<close>} two abstract objects to be assigned different special urelements,
in case they differ only in encoding properties with the same extension on the ordinary objects (by assigning them
distinct @{emph \<open>very special\<close>} urelements).

This extended model validates the following two axioms
(see~\nameref{AOT:AOT_Axioms.AOT_ExtendedModel.indistinguishable_ord_enc_all},~\nameref{AOT:AOT_Axioms.AOT_ExtendedModel.indistinguishable_ord_enc_ex}):

  \<^item> @{thm indistinguishable_ord_enc_all[rename_abs F G u G u, of \<Pi> x y, axiom_inst, print_as_theorem]}
  \<^item> @{thm indistinguishable_ord_enc_ex[rename_abs F G u G u, of \<Pi> x y, axiom_inst, print_as_theorem]}

I.e. if two abstract objects are (exemplification-)indistinguishable, then they
(1) co-encode all properties that are necessarily equivalent on the ordinary objects to any given denoting
property term @{term \<Pi>} and (2) if either one encodes any property that is necessarily equivalent to
@{term \<Pi>} on the ordinary objects, there is also such a property that is encoded by the other.

While this formulation of the axioms is rather complex and not particularly intuitive, we can equivalently
(given the necessary and sufficient conditions for relation terms to denote we contributed
to AOT as a theorem; TODO: cite) state them as follows
(see~\nameref{AOT:AOT_ExtendedRelationComprehension.denotes_all},~\nameref{AOT:AOT_ExtendedRelationComprehension.denotes_ex_neg}):

\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] denotes_all[of _ F, print_as_theorem] denotes_ex_neg[of _ F, print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}

I.e. (1) @{emph \<open>encoding @{emph \<open>all\<close>} properties that are necessarily equivalent on the ordinary objects to a
given property @{term F}\<close>} denotes a property and (2) @{emph \<open>not encoding @{emph \<open>any\<close>} property that is necessarily
equivalent on the ordinary objects to a given property @{term F}\<close>} denotes a property.

The following comprehension principles are derivable from the fact that above properties
denote (see~\nameref{AOT:AOT_ExtendedRelationComprehension.Comprehension_1},~\nameref{AOT:AOT_ExtendedRelationComprehension.Comprehension_2}):

\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] Comprehension_1[of _ \<phi>, print_as_theorem] Comprehension_2[of _ \<phi>, print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}

We call @{term \<phi>} a @{emph \<open>condition on extensions on ordinary objects\<close>}, just in case that
@{term \<open>print_as_theorem \<guillemotleft>\<box>\<forall>F\<forall>G(\<box>G \<equiv>\<^sub>E F \<rightarrow> (\<phi>{F} \<equiv> \<phi>{G}))\<guillemotright>\<close>}.
Then the comprehension principles state that for any condition @{term \<phi>} on extensions on ordinary objects,
both @{emph \<open>encoding all properties that satisfy @{term \<phi>}\<close>} and
@{emph \<open>encoding only properties that satisfy @{term \<phi>}\<close>} denote properties.

In combination these two principles yield the following (see~\nameref{AOT:AOT_ExtendedRelationComprehension.Comprehension_3}):@{footnote \<open>However, note that above
principles are stronger, i.e. they are @{emph \<open>not\<close>} derivable from the combined principle.\<close>}
\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] Comprehension_3[of _ \<phi>, print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}

I.e. for every condition @{term \<open>\<phi>\<close>} on extensions on ordinary objects,
@{emph \<open>encoding exactly those properties that satisfy @{term \<open>\<phi>\<close>}\<close>} denotes a property.

It is easy to show that @{emph \<open>being an @{term F}, s.t. actually exemplifying @{term F} is equinumerous
to @{term G}\<close>}, is a condition on extensions on ordinary objects. Hence it is a consequence of
this last comprehension principle that @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<lambda>x \<forall>F (x[F] \<equiv> [\<lambda>z \<^bold>\<A>[F]z] \<approx>\<^sub>E G)]\<down>\<guillemotright>\<close>} and
thereby @{emph \<open>numbering a property\<close>} and, consequently, the predecessor relation denote by coexistence.

\<close>

subsubsection\<open>Justification of the Comprehension Principles\<close>text\<open>\label{JustificationExtendedComprehension}\<close>

text\<open>
While the predecessor axiom (that asserts that the predecessor relation denotes) singles out a particular relation
among abstract objects for the sole purpose of defining a mathematical relation, the comprehension principles we
suggest provide a general means to construct relations among abstract objects based on specific encoding
patterns in a manner that is provably consistent, but also independently justifiable.

TODO: remark this?: In the following we use the terms @{emph \<open>distinguishable\<close>} and @{emph \<open>indistinguishable\<close>} with respect
to @{emph \<open>exemplification\<close>}, not @{emph \<open>encoding\<close>}.

In general, the burden of justification rather lies in the fact that some abstract objects @{emph \<open>are\<close>}
exemplification-indistinguishable: let @{term R\<^sub>t} be the relation @{emph \<open>thinking about\<close>}, s.t. 
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[R\<^sub>t]xy\<guillemotright>\<close>} can be read as @{term x} is thinking about @{term y}. Then for two distinct abstract
objects @{term a} and @{term b} to be exemplification-indistinguishable implies that it is impossible
for anyone to think about one without thinking about the other: @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>\<forall>x \<box>([R\<^sub>t]xa \<equiv> [R\<^sub>t]xb)\<guillemotright>\<close>}.
While the existence of such objects is justifiable, it is not necessarily a pre-theoretic intuition.
Interestingly, it is not possible to independently construct two abstract objects that
are in fact exemplification-indistinguishable: while it is provable that there @{emph \<open>exist\<close>} such
pairs of objects, the construction always has to rely on constructing one of the objects particularly
in such a way that it cannot be distinguished from the other.@{footnote \<open>And even this is only possible
for specific choices of a first abstract object: For example, we cannot construct an abstract object that
is indistinguishable from the null-object (that encodes no properties) since we can always conceive of a
model that maps the null-object to a designated special urelement that no other abstract object maps to.\<close>}
Whenever two abstract objects are constructed independently, a model can generally choose two distinct
special urelements for them, thereby making them distinguishable. Only if the construction of the
second abstract object @{emph \<open>depends\<close>} on the choice of a special urelement for the first and forces
both objects to be collapsed under the mapping from abstract objects to special urelements,
this becomes infeasible.

This helps in consolidating the fact that there are indistinguishable abstract object with pre-theoretic
intuition: given two independent abstract objects, we can always find ourselves thinking about one, but
not the other. However, we can conceive of concepts that themselves involve @{emph \<open>being indistinguishable from other
abstract objects\<close>}, for which a clever construction in fact yields distinct concepts that are indistinguishable.@{footnote \<open>In particular considering the concept of being
indistinguishable from other abstract objects that do not encode being indistinguishable from themselves
is the basic idea of the proof that there are indistinguishable abstract objects. We provide a variant of the
proof that makes this idea more explicit in TODO: cite\<close>}

So while we can always consistently distinguish between @{emph \<open>particular, independent\<close>} abstract objects,
given that there still @{emph \<open>are\<close>} indistinguishable abstract objects, we cannot formulate
a completely general principle that allows for distinguishing @{emph \<open>arbitrary\<close>} abstract objects.

However, our suggested comprehension principles are restricted to abstract objects that have encoding
conditions that differ in exemplification patterns on the @{emph \<open>ordinary\<close>} objects.
If for two abstract objects we can point to a property @{term F}, s.t. one of the object encodes @{emph \<open>all\<close>} properties
that are equivalent on the ordinary objects to @{term F} and the other one doesn't, or one
encodes @{emph \<open>none\<close>} of the properties that are equivalent on the ordinary objects to @{term F},
while the other one encodes at least one, we have a concrete criterion for telling the abstract objects
apart, so there is no justification for them to remain indistinguishable.

In the following, we note some caveats of the suggested comprehension principle and conjecture that
it is possible to require further classes of abstract objects to be exemplification-distinguishable.
However, our construction already shows that it is not necessary to justify the predecessor relation directly
as a denoting relation (and that requiring it to denote by axiom does not mean introducing
an intrinstically mathematical axiom). We could generalize the issue to the question of when abstract objects can
be assured to be exemplification-distinguishable. In this more general question we no longer see any ties to
Mathematics whatsoever, but rather a metaphysical discussion of the nature of abstract objects and
relations among them. (TODO: rephrase and polish)

While the comprehension principles suggested above are justifiable and allow for deriving
that useful encoding conditions such as @{emph \<open>numbering a property\<close>} can be abstracted to properties,
they are not the only conceivable way of generically extending AOT with relations among abstract objects.

In particular, it does @{emph \<open>not\<close>} follow from the suggested principles that any of the
following properties denote:

  \<^item> @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<lambda>x \<forall>F (x[F] \<rightarrow> \<box>\<forall>z ([F]z \<rightarrow> O!z))]\<guillemotright>\<close>}, i.e. @{emph \<open>encoding only properties that
     are necessarily restricted to ordinary objects.\<close>}
  \<^item> @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<lambda>x ExtensionOf(x, [\<lambda>z O!z & [G]z])]\<guillemotright>\<close>} where @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>ExtensionOf(x,[G])\<guillemotright>\<close>} is defined
    by PLM as @{thm "exten-property:1"[of x G]}.

The notion of an @{emph \<open>extension on the ordinary objects\<close>} we used above would have to be defined as:

\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] OrdinaryExtensionOf[of x G]}
\end{quote}

In which case @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<lambda>x OrdinaryExtensionOf(x, [G])]\<down>\<guillemotright>\<close>} is in fact derivable from the suggested
principles (TODO: proof). 

While there are merits to this conception of extensions on ordinary objects (TODO: elaborate?), it has some 
potentially counter-intuitive implications:

If one abstract objects encodes all properties that are necessarily equivalent to @{emph \<open>being
an ordinary table\<close>}, but another one fails to encode any such property, our comprehension principles
are @{emph \<open>not\<close>} sufficient for telling them apart. Our condition involves encoding all properties
that are necessarily equivalent @{emph \<open>on the ordinary objects\<close>} to a given property, so we can merely
tell an object apart that encodes @{emph \<open>all\<close>} properties that are equivalent @{emph \<open>on the ordinary objects\<close>}
to @{emph \<open>being an ordinary table\<close>}, which also for example involves @{emph \<open>being an ordinary table or
being abstract\<close>}.

We conjecture that it is possible to further extend the models to force abstract objects to be
distinguishable, if they differ in encoding patterns among objects that are only true on the ordinary
objects, i.e. that it is possible to model for example the following:

  \<^item> @{term \<open>print_as_theorem \<guillemotleft>\<box>\<forall>x(A!x \<rightarrow> \<not>[F]x) \<rightarrow> [\<lambda>x \<forall>G (\<forall>x \<box>([G]x \<equiv> [F]x) \<rightarrow> x[G])]\<down>\<guillemotright>\<close>}
  \<^item> @{term \<open>print_as_theorem \<guillemotleft>\<box>\<forall>x(A!x \<rightarrow> \<not>[F]x) \<rightarrow> [\<lambda>x \<not>\<exists>G (\<forall>x \<box>([G]x \<equiv> [F]x) & x[G])]\<down>\<guillemotright>\<close>}

However, at the time of writing, we have not yet constructed any such models and leave a further
refinement of the comprehension principles to future research.

section\<open>Modelling Possible Richness of Objects\<close>text\<open>\label{modell-modal-axiom}\<close>

text\<open>

Recall that the axiom of possible richness of objects was stated as follows (see~\nameref{AOT:modal-axiom}):

\begin{quote}
@{thm[display] "modal-axiom"[axiom_inst, of _ G, print_as_theorem]}
\end{quote}

Compared with the predecessor axiom, modelling possible richness of objects is straightforward.
The axiom implies that there are countably infinitely many ordinary (even though potentially
not @{emph \<open>actually\<close>}, but merely @{emph \<open>possibly\<close>} concrete) objects, so in our models we simply require there being a surjection from our type
@{typ \<omega>} of ordinary urelements to Isabelle's type of natural numbers @{typ nat}.
While deriving the axiom from this change in the model is still non-trivial, we can prove (notably,
we use AOT's defined mathematical induction for the proof), that @{emph \<open>being a natural number\<close>} in the models
corresponds to encoding only properties that are actually exemplified by only finitely many
ordinary objects. Thereby whenever a natural number numbers a property, it is only actually
exemplified by a finite number of ordinary objects and since we have required infinitely many
ordinary objects in our model, we can produce a witness to the claim of the axiom (modulo
some further modal reasoning).

Furthermore, there is no way to model the axiom @{emph \<open>without\<close>} extending the domain of
ordinary objects in the model to infinitely many objects.

So for this axiom, the more interesting issue compared to modelling it is whether it can be philosophically
justified as a purely logical axiom or not. It is interesting to note that the axiom does not
require @{emph \<open>actual completed infinity\<close>}, but merely @{emph \<open>potential infinity\<close>}, which is
philosophically less controversial (TODO: cite).
While we do not presume to judge whether this fact and the justifications provided by Zalta and
Nodelmann in (TODO: cite PLM) is sufficient to consider this axiom purely logical, we certainly
agree that it captures a natural and intuitive conception of @{emph \<open>counting\<close>}, without which
it is not easy to conceive how there being a successor for each natural numbers could arise as a
natural principle.

TODO: check if this duplicates earlier discussion.

section\<open>On the Prospect of an Enhanced Version of the Construction\<close>text\<open>\label{NewNumberTheory}\<close>

text\<open>
At the time of writing, there is a debate over the changing the analysis of Natural
Numbers. Instead of restricting the analysis to ordinary objects, identity on the
ordinary objects and equinumerosity on the ordinary object, Zalta and Nodelmann brought
up the idea to instead follow the same basic construction relative to @{emph \<open>discernible objects\<close>}.

Being discernible (@{text \<open>D!\<close>}) could, for example, be defined as the following
relation:

@{term[display] \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<lambda>x O!x \<or> A!x & \<forall>y (y \<noteq> x \<rightarrow> \<exists>F \<not>([F]x \<equiv> [F]y))]\<guillemotright>\<close>}

It can be proven using the necessary and sufficient conditions for relations to denote
discussed in section~\ref{KirchnersTheorem}, that this relation denotes. Furthermore, similarly
to being ordinary, @{text \<open>D!\<close>} constitutes a rigid restriction condition. Similar to
@{text \<open>=\<^sub>E\<close>} on the ordinary objects, an identity on the discernible objects @{text \<open>=\<^sub>D\<close>} can be
defined as @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<lambda>xy \<box>\<forall>F([F]x \<equiv> [F]y)]\<guillemotright>\<close>}. The construction up until the
modal axiom requiring possible richness of ordinary objects works without any major
changes relative to being discernible, the identity of discernibles and being
equinumerous@{text \<open>\<^sub>D\<close>} (defined just as equinumerous@{text \<open>\<^sub>E\<close>} in section~\ref{DefinitionOfEquinumerosity}, just relative
to discernible objects instead).

Now the idea is that @{emph \<open>being a number\<close>} becomes a property and natural numbers
themselves become discernible. This would allow for abandoning the modal axiom for
possible richness of ordinary objects and instead to more closely follow Frege's
construction, in which the successor of a number @{text n} is defined as the number
of the property @{emph \<open>being smaller-or-equal to @{text n}\<close>}, i.e. @{text \<open>n\<^bold>' = #[\<lambda>m m \<le> n]\<close>}.

At the time of writing, we have prototypes for models of this new derivation available,
but not all details of the new construction have been worked out yet (both on the
proof-theoretic and the model-theoretic side).

However, we conjecture that not only a version of this new construction can be shown
to be sound, but also that it will allow refining generalized relation comprehension.
In particular, in the future we expect it to be possible to distinguish abstract objects
arbitrarily by adding special urelements, as long as the cardinality of the set of special
urelements remains bounded, e.g. if there is only countably many such distinguishable classes of abstract objects
(while countably many distinctions between abstract objects already implies that there are uncountably
many abstract objects).

While we do not expect it to be a strong requirement of such models (i.e. we do not
expect that assuming larger cardinalities will lead to paradox), it may be reasonable to
assume that while there are uncountably many abstract objects, it is only ever possible to
distinguish at most countably many of them, resp. the set of abstract object can only
ever be partitioned in countably many disjoint distinguishable subsets. Or in other words:
letting special urelements form a countable disjoint covering of the uncountable set
of abstract objects may lead to a class of models that is sufficiently large to cover
most use cases of AOT.

However, at the time of writing it is unclear whether it would be possible to formulate
this new principle in form of a general comprehension principle in AOT itself similar to
the extended relation comprehension we described in section~\ref{pred}, or whether it will
merely result in a meta-theoretical principle by which concrete axiomatic extensions of the
system that assert the existence of relations among abstract objects can be easily judged
with respect to their soundness.
