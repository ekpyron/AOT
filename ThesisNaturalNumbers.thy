chapter\<open>Natural Numbers in AOT\<close>

text\<open>
While AOT can represent mathematical theories including their deductive systems themselves
as @{emph \<open>abstract objects\<close>}, as mentioned in section (TODO: ref), it distinguishes this analysis of
@{emph \<open>Theoretical Mathematics\<close>} from the notion of @{emph \<open>Natural Mathematics\<close>}. @{emph \<open>Natural\<close>}
Mathematics consists of ordinary, pretheoretic claims about mathematical objects (TODO: cite PLM (303))
and arise directly as abstraction of the exemplification patterns of ordinary objects rather
than being based on the axioms of some mathematical theory.

Following this idea, the claim of PLM's Chapter 14 (TODO: cite) is that natural numbers and Peano
Arithmetic can be naturally defined within object theory and the laws they abide by up to and including
Second-Order Peano Arithmetic can be derived without having to appeal to any intrinsically mathematical
axioms or notions.

We have reproduced parts of this construction in our implementation@{footnote \<open>At the
time of writing the implementation encompasses the construction of natural numbers including
mathematical induction. We expect a full derivation of Second-Order Peano Arithmetic in the
foreseeable future.\<close>} and arrived at the following results:
\<^item> The construction of natural numbers is sound and mathematical induction is derivable.
\<^item> We could model the additional axioms required in the construction in our framework.
\<^item> We could generalize one of the aforementioned axioms, strengthening the theoretical basis and
  justification of the construction.
\<^item> We could suggest several amendments to the construction and discover and fix several
  minor errors and inconsistencies in the presentation.

TODO: formatting in PDF rendering is off.
Interestingly, there are interactions between this construction and the paradox discovered
in~\cite{Thesis} and discussed in TODO: cite session. We will describe this interaction in more
detail in the following sections while reproducing the construction of Nodelman and Zalta and
thereby show how our work towards amending object theory to overcome the paradox was a prerequisite
for the current version of the construction.

TODO: remark about forgoing details about significance of terms, while PLM and the implementation
make them explicit.

section\<open>General Idea of the Construction\<close>

text\<open>
The strategy for constructing natural numbers in AOT follows the idea of Frege's Theorem. (TODO: cite.)
Frege showed that the Peano axioms can be derived from @{emph \<open>Hume's Principle\<close>} using Second-Order
Logic. Hume's Principle states that the number of @{term F}s is equal to the number of @{term G}s if and
only if @{term F} and @{term G} are @{emph \<open>equinumerous\<close>}. Two relations are @{emph \<open>equinumerous\<close>},
if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between them or, in other words, if and only if
there is a bijection between the objects exemplifying @{term F} and @{term G}. (TODO: add some citations).

Frege himself derived Hume's Principle from @{emph \<open>Basic Law V\<close>}, which together with second-order
logic leads to Russel's Paradox. However, deriving Peano arithmetic @{emph \<open>from\<close>} Hume's Principle
itself does not require @{emph \<open>Basic Law V\<close>}. In Chapter 14 PLM, Nodelman and Zalta propose a
definition of @{emph \<open>equinumerosity\<close>} and @{emph \<open>the number of @{term F}s\<close>} in object theory
and derive Hume's Principle. Based on that Natural Numbers and Peano Arithmetic become consistently
derivable as expected.

section\<open>Equinumerosity of Relations\<close>

text\<open>On the basis of traditional mathematical training based on set theory and functional logic,
the seemingly most natural conception of @{emph \<open>equinumerosity\<close>} is based on the notion of a
bijection. Two properties are equinumerous, respectively they count the same number of objects,
if and only if there is a bijection between the sets of objects they exemplify.

However, this conception of equinumerosity relies on objects of theoretical mathematics
and their axiomatization (sets, functions, bijections). While object theory can in fact define
those notions as well, it takes relations to be the more primitive, fundamental concept and thereby
prefers a definition in terms of relations alone.

The concept of there being a bijection between the sets of objects two properties exemplify can 
equivalently be captured by the notion of there being a @{emph \<open>one-to-one correspondence\<close>} between
the properties.

A @{emph \<open>one-to-one correspondence\<close>} between the properties @{term F} and @{term G} is a relation
@{term R}, s.t. (1) for every object @{term x} that exemplifies @{term F}, there is a unique object
@{term y} exemplifying @{term G}, s.t. @{term x} bears @{term R} to @{term y} and conversely (2) for
every object @{term y} that exemplifies @{term G}, there is a unique object @{term x} exemplifying
@{term F}, s.t. @{term x} bears @{term R} to @{term y}. Formally:@{footnote \<open>Note that similar to
the previous sections we are again directly quoting theorems verified in the Isabelle theory.\<close>}

@{lemma[display] \<open>print_as_theorem \<guillemotleft>R |: F \<^sub>1\<^sub>-\<^sub>1\<longleftrightarrow> G \<equiv> \<forall>x ([F]x \<rightarrow> \<exists>!y ([G]y & [R]xy)) & \<forall>y ([G]y \<rightarrow> \<exists>!x ([F]x & [R]xy))\<guillemotright>\<close> by (auto dest: "&E" "1-1-cor"[THEN "\<equiv>\<^sub>d\<^sub>fE"] intro!: print_as_theoremI "\<equiv>I" "\<rightarrow>I" "&I" "cqt:2[const_var]"[axiom_inst] "1-1-cor"[THEN "\<equiv>\<^sub>d\<^sub>fI"])}

However, this unrestricted notion of one-to-one correspondence is not well suited for a definition
of equinumerosity that validates Hume's principle. The intuitive reason for this is that abstract
objects cannot be counted. In particular, recall that there are distinct, but
exemplification-indistinguishable abstract objects (TODO: make sure this is mentioned earlier):

@{thm[display] "aclassical2"[print_as_theorem]}

Based on this fact, we can prove that there is no one-to-one correspondence between @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>A!\<guillemotright>\<close>}
and itself:@{footnote \<open>We choose this opportunity to showcase that reasoning in object theory using
our embedding in Isabelle is intuitively understandable. TODO: maybe add "once more"\<close>}

So if @{emph \<open>equinumerosity\<close>} was contingent on the existence of a full one-to-one correspondence,
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>A!\<guillemotright>\<close>} would not be equinumerous to itself and consequently equinumerosity
would not be an equivalence relation. However, Frege's Theorem does rely on equinumerosity being
an equivalence relation. Fortunately, there is a natural solution to this issue.
As mentioned in the introduction of this chapter, natural mathematics arises from abstracting
patterns of @{emph \<open>ordinary\<close>} objects. And ordinary objects are what can naturally be counted.
Hence Nodelman and Zalta introduce the notion of one-to-one correspondences among the ordinary
objects. To that end, they introduce the restricted variables @{term u}, @{term v}, @{term r}, @{term s}
that range over only the ordinary objects.@{footnote \<open>Recall the discussion about reproducing
restricted variables in the embedding in: TODO.\<close>} Using these restricted variables, a one-to-one
correspondence among the ordinary objects can be defined in the same way as a full one-to-one
correspondence:

@{lemma[display] \<open>print_as_theorem \<guillemotleft>R |: F \<^sub>1\<^sub>-\<^sub>1\<longleftrightarrow>\<^sub>E G \<equiv> \<forall>u ([F]u \<rightarrow> \<exists>!v ([G]v & [R]uv)) & \<forall>v ([G]v \<rightarrow> \<exists>!u ([F]u & [R]uv))\<guillemotright>\<close> by (auto dest: "&E" "equi:2"[THEN "\<equiv>\<^sub>d\<^sub>fE"] intro!: print_as_theoremI "\<equiv>I" "\<rightarrow>I" "&I" "cqt:2[const_var]"[axiom_inst] "equi:2"[THEN "\<equiv>\<^sub>d\<^sub>fI"])}

Based on one-to-one correspondences on the ordinary objects, equinumerosity on the ordinary objects
can be defined and can indeed shown to be an equivalence relation: TODO: sketch the proofs at least
a bit? At least cite through the progression of theorems leading to them.

@{thm[display] "equi:3"[of F G] "eq-part:1"[of _ F, print_as_theorem] "eq-part:2"[of _ F G, print_as_theorem] "eq-part:3"[of _ F G H, print_as_theorem]}
\<close>

section\<open>The Number of Fs and Hume's Theorem\<close>

text\<open>
To state Hume's Theorem additionally to the definition of @{emph \<open>equinumerosity\<close>} above,
a definition of @{emph \<open>The Number of @{term F}s\<close>} (written as @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>#F\<guillemotright>\<close>}) is required.
To that end Nodelman and Zalta (following Frege) first define what it means for an object
to number a property as follows:

@{thm[display] "numbers[den]"[THEN "\<rightarrow>E", OF "cqt:2[const_var]"[axiom_inst], of _ x G, print_as_theorem]}

An abstract object @{term x} numbers a property @{term G}, if it encodes exactly those properties,
such that @{emph \<open>actually exemplifying\<close>} them is equinumerous to @{term G}.
An alternative choice would be to forgo the actuality operator and merely require that @{term x}
encodes exactly those properties that are equinumerous to @{term F} itself.@{footnote \<open>Note
that earlier derivations used this definition, but were amended in the more recent presentation
of number theory in PLM. TODO: Cite e.g. \url{http://mally.stanford.edu/Papers/numbers.pdf\<close>}.}
 However, this would have the undesirable consequence that numbering properties would depend on modal context. For a detailed
discussion of this issue refer to (TODO: cite PLM; maybe reproduce some of it here).

Now @{emph \<open>The Number of @{term G}s\<close>} can simply be defined as @{emph \<open>the\<close>} object that numbers
@{term G}:

@{thm[display] "num-def:1"}

Using these definitions Nodelman and Zalta can indeed derive Hume's theorem:

@{thm[display] "hume:2"[of F G]}

Note that, due to the fact that AOT's definite descriptions are modally rigid and refer to objects
in the actual world, this theorem is not modally strict.@{footnote \<open>This is signified by the turnstile
symbol @{text "\<^bold>\<turnstile>"}. Modally-strict theorems, in contrast, are signified by @{text "\<^bold>\<turnstile>\<^sub>\<box>"}. However,
for increased readability we adopt the convention that unmarked theorems are understood to be
modally-strict. We have configured Isabelle's pretty printing accordingly.\<close>} However, the following variant is a necessary fact (TODO: think about poking Zalta by equating modally strict and necessary):

@{thm[display] "hume-strict"[of _ F G, print_as_theorem]}

The details of this derivation are described in PLM TODO: cite and are implemented in our
embedding in TODO: cite.

  Given the fact that we defined numbers by means of the properties they number, which is in particular based
on the number of objects those properties exemplify, a natural definition of the number zero arises.
The number zero is the object that numbers the empty property, to be more precise the number of
@{emph \<open>being a non-self-identical ordinary object\<close>}.@{footnote \<open>To be precise being a
non-self-identical@{text \<open>\<^sub>E\<close>} object. This distincation is non-trivial: While @{thm ord_eq_e_eq[of _ x, print_as_theorem]} is a theorem,
due to the hyperintensionality of object theory, it does not have to be the case that
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<lambda>x O!x & x \<noteq>\<^sub>E x]\<guillemotright>\<close>} and @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>[\<lambda>x O!x & x \<noteq> x]\<guillemotright>\<close>} are the same property. So
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>#[\<lambda>x O!x & x \<noteq>\<^sub>E x]\<guillemotright>\<close>} and @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>#[\<lambda>x O!x & x \<noteq> x]\<guillemotright>\<close>} are not the same object
@{emph \<open>a priori\<close>}, even though it is of course a theorem that they are identical. But this theorem
has to appeal to the fact that both properties are equinumerous and to Hume's Theorem.
Further examples of terms denoting zero are @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>#[\<lambda>x x \<noteq> x]\<guillemotright>\<close>} and
@{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>#[\<lambda>x \<exists>p (p & \<not>p)]\<guillemotright>\<close>} also denote the same object. More generally we can prove that
@{thm "0F:3"[of _ F, print_as_theorem]} (TODO: cite proof), i.e. the number of any property
that's necessarily not exemplified by any ordinary object is zero.\<close>}

@{thm[display] "zero:1"}

Note that while the above definition introduces the number zero as (abstract) object, we have not
defined the notion of a @{emph \<open>Natural Number\<close>} yet, nor shown that the number zero indeed @{emph \<open>is\<close>} a
natural number. The definition of @{emph \<open>Natural Number\<close>} will rely on introducing a @{emph \<open>predecessor\<close>}
relation and, intuitively speaking, defining that an abstract object is a natural number, if there is
a series of objects starting at zero, ending at the given abstract object, s.t. two consecutive objects
in that series bear the predecessor relation to each other. While we will describe this construction
in detail in the following sections, we can already define the strictly more general@{footnote \<open>It will
be a theorem that @{term \<open>\<guillemotleft>#O!\<guillemotright>\<close>} is a natural cardinal that is infinite and not a natural number.\<close>} notion of a
@{emph \<open>Natural Cardinal\<close>} and it will immediately follow that zero is a natural cardinal.
An object @{term x} is a natural cardinal, just in case that there is a property @{term G},
s.t. @{term x} is the number of @{term G}s:

@{thm[display] card[of x]}

By the definition of the number zero, it becomes immediately apparent that zero is a natural cardinal:

@{thm[display] "zero-card"[print_as_theorem]}

section\<open>Ancestral Relations and Transitive Closures\<close>

text\<open>
As mentioned above, @{emph \<open>Natural Numbers\<close>} will, informally speaking, be defined by the means of
series of objects that bear a (yet to be introduced) predecessor relation to each other.
However, traditionally, a series of objects relies on it being possible to index its objects using a
continuous sequence of natural numbers. Since our goal is to @{emph \<open>define\<close>} natural numbers, using
this traditional notion of a series is not an option.
Instead we construct @{emph \<open>ancestral relations\<close>}. In particular the @{emph \<open>weak ancestral\<close>} of
certain relations will match the concept of the transitive closure of the relation.
Natural numbers will be defined as the objects to which the number zero bears the
@{emph \<open>weak ancestral\<close>} of the predecessor relation, i.e. the objects that are transitively preceded by zero.

The first step in this process is to define being a @{emph \<open>hereditary\<close>} property with respect to
a relation, which will lead to a definition of the @{emph \<open>strong ancestral\<close>} of a relation.

@{term F}, then @{term y} exemplifies @{term F}:
