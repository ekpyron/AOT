section{* Embedding *}

subsection{* Primitives *}

text{*
The background theory for the embedding is Isabelle/HOL, that provides a higher order logic
that serves as our meta-logic. For a short overview of the extents of the background theory
see \cite{WhatsInMain}.

The following primitive types are the basis of the embedding:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Type @{type i} represents possible worlds in the Kripke semantics.
  \item Type @{type j} represents \emph{states} that are used for different interpretations
        of relations and connectives to achieve a hyper-intensional logic (see below).
  \item Type @{type bool} represents meta-logical truth values (@{text "True"} or @{text "False"})
        and is inherited from Isabelle/HOL.
  \item Type @{type \<omega>} represents ordinary urelements.
  \item Type @{type \<sigma>} represents special urelements.
\end{itemize}

Two constants are introduced:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The constant @{term dw} of type @{typeof dw} represents the designated actual world.
  \item The constant @{term dj} of type @{typeof dj} represents the designated actual state.
\end{itemize}

Based on the primitive types above the following types are defined:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Type @{type \<o>} is defined as the set of all functions of type @{typ "j\<Rightarrow>i\<Rightarrow>bool"} and
        represents truth values in the embedded logic.
  \item Type @{type \<upsilon>} is defined as @{datatype \<upsilon>}. This type represents urelements and an object
        of this type can be either an ordinary or a special urelement (with the respective type
        constructors @{term \<omega>\<upsilon>} and @{term \<sigma>\<upsilon>}).
  \item Type @{type \<Pi>\<^sub>0} is defined as a synonym for type @{type \<o>} and represents zero-place
        relations.
  \item Type @{type \<Pi>\<^sub>1} is defined as the set of all functions of type \mbox{@{typ "\<upsilon>\<Rightarrow>j\<Rightarrow>i\<Rightarrow>bool"}}
        and represents one-place relations (for an urelement a one-place relation evaluates
        to a truth value in the embedded logic; for an urelement, a state and a possible world
        it evaluates to a meta-logical truth value).
  \item Type @{type \<Pi>\<^sub>2} is defined as the set of all functions of type \mbox{@{typ "\<upsilon>\<Rightarrow>\<upsilon>\<Rightarrow>j\<Rightarrow>i\<Rightarrow>bool"}}
        and represents two-place relations.
  \item Type @{type \<Pi>\<^sub>3} is defined as the set of all functions of type \mbox{@{typ "\<upsilon>\<Rightarrow>\<upsilon>\<Rightarrow>\<upsilon>\<Rightarrow>j\<Rightarrow>i\<Rightarrow>bool"}}
        and represents three-place relations.
  \item Type @{type \<alpha>} is defined as a synonym of the type of sets of one-place relations @{text "\<Pi>\<^sub>1 set"},
        i.e. every set of one-place relations constitutes an object of type @{type \<alpha>}. This type
        represents abstract objects.
  \item Type @{type \<nu>} is defined as @{datatype \<nu>}. This type represents individuals and can
        be either an ordinary urelement @{type \<omega>} or an abstract object @{type \<alpha>} (with the
        respective type constructors @{term \<omega>\<nu>} and @{term \<alpha>\<nu>}.
  \item Type @{type \<kappa>} is defined as the set of all objects of type @{typ "\<nu> option"} and
        represents individual terms. The type @{typ "'a option"} is part of Isabelle/HOL and
        consists of a type constructor @{term "Some x"} for an object @{term "x"} of type @{typ 'a}
        (in our case type @{type \<nu>}) and an additional special element called @{term "None"}.
        @{term "None"} is used to represent individual terms that are definite descriptions
        that do not denote an individual.
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
  The Isabelle syntax @{text "typedef \<o> = UNIV::(j\<Rightarrow>i\<Rightarrow>bool) set morphisms eval\<o> make\<o> .."}
  introduces a new abstract type @{type \<o>} that is represented by the full set (@{term UNIV})
  of objects of type @{typ "j\<Rightarrow>i\<Rightarrow>bool"}. The morphism @{text "eval\<o>"} maps an object of
  abstract type @{type \<o>} to its representative of type @{typ "j\<Rightarrow>i\<Rightarrow>bool"}, whereas 
  the morphism @{text "make\<o>"} maps an object of type @{typ "j\<Rightarrow>i\<Rightarrow>bool"} to the object
  of type @{type \<o>} that is represented by it. Defining these abstract types makes it
  possible to consider the defined types as primitives in later stages of the embedding,
  once their meta-logical properties are derived from the underlying representation.
  For a theoretical analysis of the representation layer the type @{type \<o>} can be considered
  a synonym of @{typ "j\<Rightarrow>i\<Rightarrow>bool"}.

  The Isabelle syntax @{text "setup_lifting type_definition_\<o>"} allows definitions for the
  abstract type @{type \<o>} to be stated directly for its representation type @{typ "j\<Rightarrow>i\<Rightarrow>bool"}
  using the syntax @{text "lift_definition"}.

  In the remainder of this document these morphisms are omitted and definitions are stated
  directly for the representation types.
\end{remark}

subsection{* Individual Terms and Definite Descriptions *}

text{*
There are two basic types of individual terms: definite descriptions and individual variables.
For any logically proper definite description there is an individual variable that denotes
the same object.

In the embedding the type @{type \<kappa>} encompasses all individual terms, i.e. individual variables
\emph{and} definite descriptions. To use a pure individual variable (of type @{type \<nu>}) as an
object of type @{type \<kappa>} the decoration @{term "embedded_style (DUMMY\<^sup>P)"} is introduced:

@{thm[display] \<nu>\<kappa>.rep_eq[where x=x, THEN embedded_def]}

The expression @{term "embedded_style (x\<^sup>P)"} (of type @{typeof "x\<^sup>P"}) is now marked to always be
logically proper (it can only be substituted by objects that are internally of the form @{term "Some x"})
and to always denote the same object as the individual variable @{text "x"}.

It is now possible to define definite descriptions as follows:

@{thm[display] that.rep_eq[where x=\<phi>, THEN embedded_def]}

If the propriety condition of a definite description @{prop "\<exists>!x. \<phi> x dj dw"} holds,
i.e. \emph{there exists a unique @{term "x"}, such that @{term "\<phi> x"} holds for the actual state and
the actual world}, the representing individual variable is set to @{term "Some (THE x . \<phi> x dj dw)"}.
Isabelle's \emph{THE} operator evaluates to the unique object, for which the given condition holds,
if there is a unique such object, and is undefined otherwise. If the propriety condition does not hold,
the individual term is set to @{term "None"}.

The following meta-logical functions are defined to aid in handling individual terms:

@{thm[display] proper.rep_eq}

@{thm[display] rep.rep_eq}

@{term "the"} maps an object of type @{typ "'a option"} that is of the form @{term "Some x"} to
@{term "x"} and is undefined for @{term "None"}. For an object of type @{type \<kappa>} the expression
@{term "proper x"} is therefore true, if the term is logically proper, and if this is the case,
the expression @{term "rep x"} evaluates to the individual of type @{type \<nu>} that the term denotes.
*}

subsection{* Mapping from abstract objects to special Urelements *}

text{*
To map abstract objects to urelements (for which relations are defined), a constant
@{term \<alpha>\<sigma>} of type @{typeof \<alpha>\<sigma>} is introduced, which maps abstract objects (of type @{type \<alpha>})
to special urelements (of type @{type \<sigma>}).

To assure that every object in the full domain of urelements actually is an urelement for (one or more)
individual objects, the constant @{term \<alpha>\<sigma>} is axiomatized to be surjective.

*}

subsection{* Conversion between objects and Urelements *}

text{*

In order to represent relation exemplification as the function application of the meta-logical
representative of a relation, individual variables have to be converted to urelements (see below).
In order to define lambda expressions the inverse mapping is defined as well:

@{thm[display] \<nu>\<upsilon>_def}

@{thm[display] \<upsilon>\<nu>_def}

\begin{remark}
  The Isabelle notation @{term "case_\<nu>"} is used to define a function acting on objects of type
  @{type \<nu>} using the underlying types @{type \<omega>} and @{type \<alpha>}. Every object of type @{type \<nu>}
  is (by definition) either of the form @{term "\<omega>\<nu> x"} or of the form @{term "\<alpha>\<nu> x"}.
  The expression @{term "case_\<nu> \<omega>\<upsilon> (\<sigma>\<upsilon> \<circ> \<alpha>\<sigma>)"} for an argument @{term "y"} now evaluates to
  @{term "\<omega>\<upsilon> x"} if @{term "y"} is of the form @{term "\<omega>\<nu> x"} and to @{term "(\<sigma>\<upsilon> \<circ> \<alpha>\<sigma>) x"}
  (i.e. @{term "\<sigma>\<upsilon> (\<alpha>\<sigma> x)"}) if @{term "y"} is of the form @{term "\<alpha>\<nu> x"}.

  In the definition of @{term "\<upsilon>\<nu>"} the expression @{term "inv \<alpha>\<sigma>"} is part of the logic of
  Isabelle/HOL and defined as some (arbitrary) object in the preimage under @{term \<alpha>\<sigma>}, i.e. it
  holds that @{lemma "\<alpha>\<sigma> ((inv \<alpha>\<sigma>) x) = x" by (simp add: \<alpha>\<sigma>_surj surj_f_inv_f)},
  as @{term \<alpha>\<sigma>} is axiomatized to be surjective.
\end{remark}
*}

subsection{* Exemplification of n-place relations *}

text{*
  Exemplification of n-place relations can now be defined. Exemplification of zero-place
  relations is simply defined as the identity, whereas exemplification of n-place relations
  for @{text "n \<ge> 1"} is defined to be true, if all individual terms are logically proper and
  the function application of the relation to the urelements corresponding to the individuals
  yields true for a given possible world and state:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item @{thm[display] exe0.rep_eq[where x=p, THEN embedded_def]}
    \item @{thm[display] exe1.rep_eq[where x=F and xa=x, THEN embedded_def]}
    \item @{thm[display] exe2.rep_eq[where x=F and xa=x and xb=y, THEN embedded_def]}
    \item @{thm[display] exe3.rep_eq[where x=F and xa=x and xb=y and xc=z, THEN embedded_def]}
  \end{itemize}
*}

subsection{* Encoding *}

text{*
  Encoding can now be defined as follows:

  @{thm enc.rep_eq[of x F, THEN embedded_def]}

  That is for a given state @{term s} and a given possible world @{term w} it holds that
  an individual term @{term x} encodes @{term F}, if @{term x} is logically proper,
  the representative individual variable of @{term x} is of the form @{term "\<alpha>\<nu> \<alpha>"} for
  some abstract object @{term \<alpha>} and @{term F} is contained in @{term \<alpha>} (remember that
  abstract objects are defined to be sets of one-place relations). Also note that encoding
  is a represented as a function of possible worlds and states to ensure type-correctness,
  but its evaluation does not depend on either.
*}

subsection{* Connectives and Quantifiers *}

text{*
  The reason to make truth values depend on the additional primitive type of \emph{states}
  is to achieve hyper-intensionality. The connectives and quantifiers are defined in such a
  way that they behave classically if evaluated for the designated actual state @{term "dj"},
  whereas their behavior is governed by uninterpreted constants in any other state.

  For this purpose the following uninterpreted constants are introduced:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item @{const I_NOT} of type @{typeof I_NOT}
    \item @{const I_IMPL} of type @{typeof I_IMPL}
  \end{itemize}

  Modality is represented using the dependency on primitive possible worlds using
  a standard Kripke semantics for a S5 modal logic.

  The basic connectives and quantifiers are now defined as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item @{thm[display] not.rep_eq[of p, THEN embedded_def]}
    \item @{thm[display] impl.rep_eq[of p q, THEN embedded_def]}
    \item @{thm[display] forall\<^sub>\<nu>.rep_eq[of \<phi>, rename_abs s w x, THEN embedded_def]}
    \item @{thm[display] forall\<^sub>0.rep_eq[of \<phi>, rename_abs s w p, THEN embedded_def]}
    \item @{thm[display] forall\<^sub>1.rep_eq[of \<phi>, rename_abs s w F, THEN embedded_def]}
    \item @{thm[display] forall\<^sub>2.rep_eq[of \<phi>, rename_abs s w F, THEN embedded_def]}
    \item @{thm[display] forall\<^sub>3.rep_eq[of \<phi>, rename_abs s w F, THEN embedded_def]}
    \item @{thm[display] box.rep_eq[of p, THEN embedded_def]}
    \item @{thm[display] actual.rep_eq[of p, THEN embedded_def]}
  \end{itemize}

  Note in particular that the definition of negation and implication behaves
  classically if evaluated for the actual state @{term "s = dj"}, but
  is governed by the uninterpreted constants @{term I_NOT} and @{term I_IMPL} for
  @{term "s \<noteq> dj"}.
*}

subsection{* Lambda Expressions *}

text{*
  The bound variables of the lambda expressions of the embedded logic are individual
  variables, whereas relations are represented as functions acting on urelements.
  Therefore the lambda expressions of the embedded logic are defined as follows:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item @{thm[display] lambdabinder0.rep_eq[of p, THEN embedded_def]}
    \item @{thm[display] lambdabinder1.rep_eq[of \<phi>, THEN embedded_def]}
    \item @{thm[display] lambdabinder2.rep_eq[of \<phi>, THEN embedded_def]}
    \item @{thm[display] lambdabinder3.rep_eq[of \<phi>, THEN embedded_def]}
  \end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
  For technical reasons Isabelle only allows lambda expressions for one-place relations
  to use a nice binder notation. For two- and three-place relations the following notation
  can be used instead: \mbox{@{term[eta_contract=false] "embedded_style (\<^bold>\<lambda>\<^sup>2 (\<lambda> x y . \<phi> x y))"}},
  \mbox{@{term[eta_contract=false] "embedded_style (\<^bold>\<lambda>\<^sup>3 (\<lambda> x y z . \<phi> x y z))"}}.
\end{remark}

  The representation of zero-place lambda expressions as the identity is straight-forward,
  the representation of n-place lambda expressions for @{text "n \<ge> 1"} is illustrated
  for the case @{text "n = 1"}:

  The matrix of the lambda expression @{term \<phi>} is a function from individual variables
  (of type @{type \<nu>}) to truth values (of type @{type \<o>}, resp. @{typ "j\<Rightarrow>i\<Rightarrow>bool"}).
  One-place relations are represented as functions of type @{typ "\<upsilon>\<Rightarrow>j\<Rightarrow>i\<Rightarrow>bool"}, though,
  where @{type \<upsilon>} is the type of urelements.

  The evaluation of a lambda expression @{term "embedded_style (\<^bold>\<lambda>x. \<phi> x)"} for an urelment @{term u}
  therefore has to be defined as @{term "\<phi> (\<upsilon>\<nu> u)"}. Remember that @{term "\<upsilon>\<nu>"} maps an urelement
  to some (arbitrary) individual variable in its preimage. Note that this mapping is injective
  only for ordinary objects, not for abstract objects. The expression @{term "embedded_style (\<^bold>\<lambda>x. \<phi> x)"}
  only implies \emph{being @{text "x"}, such that there exists some @{text "y"} that is mapped
  to the same urelement as @{text "x"}, and it holds that @{text "\<phi> y"}}.
  Conversely, only \emph{for all @{text "y"} that are mapped to the same
  urelement as @{text "x"} it holds that @{text "\<phi> y"}} is a sufficient condition to conclude
  that @{text "x"} exemplifies @{term "embedded_style (\<^bold>\<lambda>x. \<phi> x)"}.
  \begin{remark}
    Formally the following statements hold, where @{term "[p in v]"} is the evaluation
    of the formula @{term "embedded_style p"} in the embedded logic to its meta-logical representation for
    a possible world @{text v} (and the actual state @{term dj}, for details refer to the next
    subsection):

    \begin{itemize}
      \item @{thm SanityTests.lambda_impl_meta}
      \item @{thm SanityTests.meta_impl_lambda}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{remark}

  Principia defines lambda expressions only for propositional formulas, though, i.e.
  for formulas that do \emph{not} contain encoding subformulas. The only other kind
  of formulas in which the bound variable @{term x} could be used in the matrix @{term \<phi>},
  however, are exemplication subformulas, which are defined to only depend on urelmements.
  Consider the following simple lambda-expression and the evaluation to its meta-logical
  representation:
  
  @{lemma[display] "embedded_style (\<^bold>\<lambda> x . \<lparr>F,x\<^sup>P\<rparr>) = make\<Pi>\<^sub>1 (\<lambda>u w s. eval\<Pi>\<^sub>1 F (\<nu>\<upsilon> (\<upsilon>\<nu> u)) w s)"
    by (simp add: embedded_style_def meta_defs meta_aux)}

  Further note that the following identity holds: \mbox{@{lemma "\<nu>\<upsilon> (\<upsilon>\<nu> u) = u" by (simp add: \<nu>\<upsilon>_\<upsilon>\<nu>_id)}}
  and therefore \mbox{@{lemma "embedded_style (\<^bold>\<lambda> x . \<lparr>F,x\<^sup>P\<rparr>) = F" by (simp add: embedded_style_def meta_defs meta_aux)}}, as desired.

  Therefore the defined lambda-expressions can accurately represent the lambda-expressions of the
  Principia. However the embedding still allows for lambda expressions that contain encoding
  subformulas. @{term "embedded_style \<lparr>\<^bold>\<lambda>x. \<lbrace>x\<^sup>P, F\<rbrace>, y\<^sup>P\<rparr>"} does \emph{not} imply
  @{term "embedded_style \<lbrace>y\<^sup>P, F\<rbrace>"}, but only that
  there exists an abstract object @{term z}, that is mapped to the same urelement as @{term x}
  and it holds that @{text "embedded_style \<lbrace>z\<^sup>P, F\<rbrace>"}. The former would lead to well-known
  inconsistencies, which the latter avoids.

  \begin{remark}
    Formally the following statements are true:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item @{thm[display] ArtificialTheorems.lambda_enc_4}
      \item @{thm[display] ArtificialTheorems.lambda_enc_5}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{remark}

  An example of a statement containing lambda-expressions that contain encoding subformulas
  that becomes derivable using the meta-logic is the following:

  @{lemma "[\<^bold>\<forall> F y . \<lparr>\<^bold>\<lambda>x. \<lbrace>x\<^sup>P,F\<rbrace> \<^bold>\<equiv> \<lbrace>x\<^sup>P,F\<rbrace>, y\<^sup>P\<rparr> in v]" by (simp add: meta_aux meta_defs conn_defs forall_\<nu>_def forall_\<Pi>\<^sub>1_def)}

*}

subsection{* Validity *}

text{*
  A formula is considered semantically valid for a possible world @{term v} if it evaluates
  to @{term True} for the actual state @{term dj} and the given possible world @{term v}.
  Semantic validity is defined as follows:
  
    @{thm[display] valid_in.rep_eq[of v \<phi>]}
  
  This way the truth evaluation of a proposition only depends on the evaluation of its representation
  for the actual state @{term dj}. Remember that for the actual state the connectives and quantifiers
  are defined to behave classically. In fact the only formulas of the embedded logic whose truth
  evaluation \emph{does} depend on all states are formulas containing encoding subformulas.
*}

subsection{* Concreteness *}

text{*
  Principia defines concreteness as a one-place relation constant. For the embedding care has to
  be taken that concreteness actually matches the primitive distinction between ordinary and
  abstract objects. The following requirements have to be satisfied by the introduced notion of
  concreteness:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Ordinary objects are possibly concrete. In the meta-logic this means that for every
          ordinary object there exists at least one possible world, in which the object is concrete.
    \item Abstract objects are never concrete.
  \end{itemize}

  An additional requirement is enforced by axiom (\ref{PM-qml}.4)\cite{PM}. To satisfy this
  axiom the following has to be assured:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Possibly contingent objects exist. In the meta-logic this means that there exists
          an ordinary object and two possible worlds, such that the ordinary object is
          concrete in one of the worlds, but not concrete in the other.
    \item Possibly no contingent objects exist. In the meta-logic this means that there exists
          a possible world, such that all objects that are concrete in this world, are concrete
          in all possible worlds.
  \end{itemize}

  In order to satisfy these requirements a constant @{const ConcreteInWorld} is introduced,
  that maps ordinary objects (of type @{type \<omega>}) and possible worlds (of type @{type i})
  to meta-logical truth values (of type @{type bool}). This constant is axiomatized in the
  following way:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item @{thm OrdinaryObjectsPossiblyConcreteAxiom}
    \item @{thm PossiblyContingentObjectExistsAxiom}
    \item @{thm PossiblyNoContingentObjectExistsAxiom}
  \end{itemize}

  Concreteness can now be defined as a one-place relation:

  @{thm[display] Concrete.rep_eq[THEN embedded_def]}

  The equivalence of the axioms stated in the meta-logic and the notion of concreteness in Principia
  can now be verified:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item @{thm[display] SanityTests.OrdAxiomCheck[rename_abs x v y u z z]}
    \item @{thm[display] SanityTests.AbsAxiomCheck[rename_abs x v y u z z]}
    \item @{thm[display] SanityTests.PossiblyContingentObjectExistsCheck}
    \item @{thm[display] SanityTests.PossiblyNoContingentObjectExistsCheck}
  \end{itemize}
